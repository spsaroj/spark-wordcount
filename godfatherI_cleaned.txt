               INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

                PARAMOUNT Logo presented austerely over black 
               background. There moment's hesitation, and then 
               simple words white lettering:

                                      THE GODFATHER

               While this remains, we hear: " believe America." Suddenly 
               we watching CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, man of 
               sixty, dressed black suit, verge of great emotion.

                                     BONASERA
                         America has made my fortune.

               As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

                                     BONASERA
                          raised my daughter American 
                         fashion;  gave her freedom, but 
                         taught her never to dishonor her 
                         family. She found boy friend, not 
                         Italian. She went to movies 
                         with him, stayed out late. Two months 
                         ago he took her for drive, with 
                         another boy friend. They made her 
                         drink whiskey and then they tried to 
                         take advantage of her. She resisted; 
                         she kept her honor. So they beat her 
                         like animal. When  went to 
                         hospital her nose was broken, her 
                         jaw was shattered and held together 
                         by wire, and she could not even weep 
                         because of pain.

               He can barely speak; he weeping now.

                                     BONASERA
                          went to Police like good 
                         American. These two boys were arrested 
                         and brought to trial.  judge 
                         sentenced them to three years 
                         prison, and suspended sentence. 
                         Suspended sentence! They went free 
                         that very day.  stood 
                         courtroom like fool, and those 
                         bastards, they smiled me. Then  
                         said to my wife, for Justice, we 
                         must go to  Godfather.

               By now, THE VIEW full, and we see Don Corleone's office 
               his home.

                blinds closed, and so room dark, and with 
               patterned shadows. We watching BONASERA over shoulder 
               of DON CORLEONE. TOM HAGEN sits near small table, examining 
               some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands impatiently by 
               window nearest his father, sipping from glass of wine. We 
               can HEAR music, and laughter and voices of many people 
               outside.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Bonasera, we know each other for 
                         years, but this first time 
                         come to me for help.  don't 
                         remember last time invited 
                         me to your house for coffee... even 
                         though our wives friends.

                                     BONASERA
                         What do want of me? I'll give 
                         anything want, but do what  
                         ask!

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         And what that Bonasera?

               BONASERA whispers into DON's ear.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         No. You ask for too much.

                                     BONASERA
                          ask for Justice.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                          Court gave justice.

                                     BONASERA
                         An eye for eye!

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         But your daughter still alive.

                                     BONASERA
                         Then make them suffer as she suffers.  
                         How much shall  pay you.

               Both HAGEN and SONNY react.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         You never think to protect yourself 
                         with real friends. You think it's 
                         enough to be American. All right, 
                         Police protects you, there 
                         Courts of Law, so don't need 
                         friend like me. But now come to 
                         me and say Don Corleone, must 
                         give me justice. And don't ask 
                         respect or friendship. And 
                         don't think to call me Godfather; 
                         instead come to my house 
                         day my daughter to be married and 
                         ask me to do murder... for money.

                                     BONASERA
                         America has been good to me...

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Then take justice from judge, 
                         bitter with sweet, Bonasera.  
                         But if come to me with your 
                         friendship, your loyalty, then your 
                         enemies become my enemies, and then, 
                         believe me, they would fear you...

               Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.

                                     BONASERA
                         Be my friend.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Good. From me you'll get Justice.

                                     BONASERA
                         Godfather.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Some day, and that day may never 
                         come,  would like to call upon 
                         to do me service return.

               EXT. DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

               A HIGH ANGLE of CORLEONE MALL bright daylight. There 
               least five hundred guests filling main courtyard 
               and gardens. There music and laughing and dancing and 
               countless tables covered with food and wine.

               DON CORLEONE stands Gate, flanked either side by 
               son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed formal attire of 
               wedding party. He warmly shakes hands, squeezes 
               hands of friends and guests, pinches cheeks of 
               children, and makes them all welcome. They turn carry 
               with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked 
               bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

                entire family poses for family portrait: DON CORLEONE, 
               MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN 
               and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, bride, 
               and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI. As they move into pose, 
               THE DON seems preoccupied.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Where's Michael?

                                     SONNY
                         He'll be here Pop, it's still early.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Then picture will wait for him.

               Everyone group feels uneasiness as DON moves 
               back to house. SONNY gives delicious smile 
               direction of Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI. She returns 
               it. Then he moves to his wife.

                                     SONNY
                         Sandra, watch kids. They're 
                         running wild.

                                     SANDRA
                         You watch yourself.

               HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing wine 
               barrels, where group of FOUR MEN nervously wait. TOM crooks 
               finger NAZORINE, who double checks that he next, 
               straightens, and follows HAGEN.

               EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)

               Outside main gate of Mall, SEVERAL MEN suits, 
               working together with MAN dark sedan, walk and out 
               of rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers 
               down their notebooks. We HEAR music and laughter coming 
               from party distance.

               A MAN stops limousine and copies down number.

               BARZINI, dignified black homburg, always under 
               watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to embrace 
               DON CORLEONE courtyard.

                MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another 
               number notebook. A shiny new Cadillac with wooden 
               bumpers.

               PETER CLEMENZA, dancing Tarantella joyously, bumping 
               bellies with ladies.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Paulie... wine... WINE.

               He mops his sweating forehead with big handkerchief. PAULIE 
               hustles, gets glass of icy black wine, and brings it to 
               him.

                                     PAULIE
                         You look terrif floor!

                                     CLEMENZA
                         What you, dance judge? Go do 
                         your job; take walk around 
                         neighborhood... see everything 
                         okay.

               PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes breath, and leaps 
               back into dance.

                MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another 
               number notebook.

               TESSIO, tall, gentle-looking man, dances with NINE-YEAR- 
               OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted his enormous 
               brown shoes.

                MEN move to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out 
               of gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by CLEMENZA 
               and PAULIE.

                                     SONNY
                         Buddy, this private party.

                MAN doesn't answer, but points to DRIVER of sedan.  
               SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face him.

                DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to greed card, 
               without saying word. SONNY steps back, spits ground, 
               turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE, and 
               another TWO MEN. He doesn't say thing for most of walk 
               back into courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.

                                     SONNY
                         Goddamn FBI... don't respect nothing.

               INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

               DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk 
               dark study.

                                     NAZORINE
                         ...a fine boy from Sicily, captured 
                         by American Army, and sent to 
                         New Jersey as prisoner of war...

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Nazorine, my friend, tell me what  
                         can do.

                                     NAZORINE
                         Now that war over, Enzo, this 
                         boy being repatriated to Italy.  
                         And see, Godfather...
                              (he wrings his hands, 
                              unable to express 
                              himself)
                         He... my daughter... they...

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         You want him to stay this country.

                                     NAZORINE
                         Godfather, understand everything.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Tom, what we need Act of 
                         Congress to allow Enzo to become 
                         citizen.

                                     NAZORINE
                              (impressed)
                         An Act of Congress!

                                     HAGEN
                              (nodding)
                         It will cost.

                DON shrugs; such way with those things; NAZORINE 
               nods.

                                     NAZORINE
                          that all? Godfather, thank you...
                              (backing out, 
                              enthusiastically)
                         Oh, wait till see cake  
                         made for your beautiful daughter!

               NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to GODFATHER.  
               DON CORLEONE rises and moves to Venetian blinds.

               overly-fluffy white gown against groom, CARLO RIZZI. He 
               bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.

               him long enough to thank various GUESTS for white 
               envelopes they putting into large white purse she 
               holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one 
               of her hands slid under his jacket, and into his shirt, 
               where she provocatively rubbing hair his chest.

               CARLO, other hand, has his blue eyes trained 
               bulging envelopes, and trying to guess how much cash 
               things hold.

                         silk purse. Holy Toledo, if this was

               SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and 
               further apart until she bursts into peal of laughter.

               Through her separated hands she sees Wedding Dais.

               to kiss his hand. He takes envelope from his jacket, 
               holds it out, but does not release it until he makes formal 
               speech.

                          Senator called--apologized for 
                         not coming personally, but said you'd 
                         understand. Also, some of 
                         Judges... they've all sent gifts. 
                         And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.

               DON CORLEONE not pleased.

                                     HAGEN
                          action narcotics. Sollozzo 
                         has contacts Turkey for poppy, 
                         Sicily for plants to process 
                         down to morphine or up to heroin.  
                         Also he has access to this country.  
                         He's coming to us for financial help, 
                         and some sort of immunity from 
                         law. For that we get piece of 
                         action,  couldn't find out how much.
                         Sollozzo vouched for by 
                         Tattaglia family, and they may have 
                         piece of action. They call 
                         Sollozzo Turk. He's spent lot 
                         of time Turkey and suppose to 
                         have Turkish wife and kids. He's 
                         suppose to be very quick with 
                         knife, or was, when he was younger. 
                         Only matters of business and with 
                         some reasonable complaint. Also he 
                         has American wife and three 
                         children and he good family 
                         man.

               THE DON nods.

                                     HAGEN
                         He's his own boss, and very competent.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         And with prison record.

                                     HAGEN
                         Two terms; one Italy, one 
                         United States. He's known to 
                         Government as top narcotics man.
                         That could be plus for us; he could 
                         never get immunity to testify.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         When did he call?

                                     HAGEN
                         This morning.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         On day like this. Consiglero, do 
                         also have your notes the 
                         Turk made his living from Prostitution 
                         before war, like Tattaglias 
                         do now. Write that down before 
                         forget it.  Turk will wait.

               We now begin to hear song coming over loud-speakers 
               from outside. In Italian, with unmistakable style.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         What that? It sounds like Johnny.

               He moves to window, pulls blinds up, flooding 
               room with light.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         It Johnny. He came all way 
                         from California to be wedding.

                                     HAGEN
                         Should  bring him in.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         No. Let people enjoy him. You 
                         see? He good godson.

                                     HAGEN
                         It's been two years. He's probably 
                         trouble again.

               EXT. DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

               JOHNNY FONTANE bandstand, singing to delight and 
               excitement of wedding GUESTS.

                                     KAY
                          didn't know your family knew Johnny 
                         Fontane.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Sure.

                                     KAY
                          used to come down to New York 
                         whenever he sang Capitol and 
                         scream my head off.

                                     MICHAEL
                         He's my father's godson; he owes him 
                         his whole career.

               JOHNNY finishes song and CROWD screams with delight.  
               They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         My Godson has come three thousand 
                         miles to do us honor and no one thinks 
                         to wet his throat.

               At once dozen wine glasses offered to JOHNNY, who takes 
               sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.

                                     JOHNNY
                          kept trying to call after my 
                         divorce and Tom always said were 
                         busy. When  got Wedding 
                         invitation  knew weren't sore 
                         me anymore, Godfather.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Can  do something for still?
                         You're not too rich, or too famous 
                         that  can't help you?

                                     JOHNNY
                         I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, 
                         and... my career, I'm almost washed 
                         up...

               He's very disturbed.  GODFATHER indicates that he come 
               with him to office so no one will notice. He turns to 
               HAGEN.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Tell Santino to come with us.
                         He should hear some things.

               They go, leaving HAGEN scanning party looking for SONNY.

               INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

               HAGEN glances up staircase.

                                     HAGEN
                         Sonny?

               Then he goes up.

               INT. DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

               SONNY and LUCY room upstairs; he has lifted her 
               gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing 
               against door. Her face peeks out from layers of 
               petticoats around it like flower ecstasy.

                                     LUCY
                         Sonnyeeeeeeee.

               Her head bouncing against door with rhythm of his 
               body. But there knocking as well. They stop, freeze 
               that position.

                                     HAGEN (O.S.)
                         Sonny? Sonny, there?

               INT. DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)

               Outside, HAGEN by door.

                                     HAGEN
                          old man wants you; Johnny's 
                         here... he's got problem.

                                     SONNY (O.S.)
                         Okay. One minute.

               HAGEN hesitates. We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against 
               door again. TOM leaves.

               INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         ACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ Heaven, 
                         it possible turned out no 
                         better than Hollywood finocchio.

               Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  DON 
               smiles. SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still 
               adjusting his clothes.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         All right, Hollywood... Now tell me 
                         about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta 
                         who won't let work.

                                     JOHNNY
                         He owns studio. Just month ago 
                         he bought movie rights to this 
                         book, best seller. And main 
                         character guy just like me.  
                         wouldn't even have to act, just be 
                         myself.

                DON silent, stern.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         You take care of your family?

                                     JOHNNY
                         Sure.

               He glances SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as 
               he can.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         You look terrible.  want to eat 
                         well, to rest. And spend time with 
                         your family. And then, end of 
                         month, this big shot will give 
                         part want.

                                     JOHNNY
                         It's too late. All contracts 
                         have been signed, they're almost 
                         ready to shoot.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         I'll make him offer he can't 
                         refuse.

               He takes JOHNNY to door, pinching his cheek hard enough 
               to hurt.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Now go back to party and leave 
                         it to me.

               He closes door, smiling to himself. Turns to HAGEN.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         When does my daughter leave with her 
                         bridegroom?

                                     HAGEN
                         They'll cut cake few 
                         minutes... leave right after that.
                         Your new son-in-law, do we give him 
                         something important?

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         No, give him living. But never let 
                         him know family's business. What 
                         else, Tom?

                                     HAGEN
                         I've called hospital; they've 
                         notified Consiglere Genco's family 
                         to come and wait. He won't last out 
                         night.

               This saddens DON. He sighs.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Genco will wait for me. Santino, 
                         tell your brothers they will come 
                         with me to hospital to see Genco. 
                         Tell Fredo to drive big car, and 
                         ask Johnny to come with us.

                                     SONNY
                         And Michael?

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         All my sons.
                              (to HAGEN)
                         Tom,  want to go to California 
                         tonight. Make arrangements. But 
                         don't leave until  come back from 
                         hospital and speak to you. 
                         Understood?

                                     HAGEN
                         Understood.

               EXT. DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

               Now all wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over 
               entrance of cake: NAZORINE beaming as he wheels 
               serving table containing biggest, gaudiest, most 
               extravagant wedding cake ever baked, incredible monument 
               of his gratitude.  CROWD favorably impressed: they 
               begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses, 
               traditional request for Bride to cut cake and 
               kiss Groom. Louder and louder, five hundred forks hitting 
               five hundred glasses.

               EXT. DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

               Silence.

               HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  GUESTS gone. A 
               single black car courtyard. FREDDIE behind 
               driver's seat: DON enters car, looks MICHAEL, who 
               sits between SONNY and JOHNNY rear seat.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Will your girl friend get back to 
                         city all right?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Tom said he'd take care of it.

                DON pulls door shut; and car pulls out, through 
               gate of great Corleone Mall.

               INT. DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)

               A long white hospital corridor, end of which we can 
               see grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but 
               all plump and dressed black.

               DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward end. But then 
               DON slows, putting his hand MICHAEL's shoulder. MICHAEL 
               stops and turns toward his FATHER.  two looks one 
               another for some time. SILENCE. DON CORLEONE then lifts his 
               hand, and slowly touches particular medal MICHAEL's 
               uniform.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         What was this for?

                                     MICHAEL
                         For bravery.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         And this?

                                     MICHAEL
                         For killing man.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         What miracles do for strangers.

                                     MICHAEL
                          fought for my country. It was my 
                         choice.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         And now, what do choose to do?

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'm going to finish school.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Good. When finished, come 
                         and talk to me.  have hopes for 
                         you.

               Again they regard each other without word. MICHAEL turns, 
               and continues on. DON CORLEONE watches moment, and then 
               follows.

               INT. DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

               DON CORLEONE enters hospital room, moving closest to OUR 
               VIEW. He followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and WOMEN.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                              (whispered)
                         Genco, I've brought my sons to pay 
                         their respects. And look, even Johnny 
                         Fontane, all way from Hollywood.

               GENCO tiny, wasted skeleton of man. DON CORLEONE takes 
               his bony hand, as others arrange themselves around his 
               bed, each clasping other hand turn.

                                     GENCO
                         Godfather, Godfather, it's your 
                         daughter's wedding day, cannot 
                         refuse me. Cure me, have 
                         power.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                          have no such power... but Genco, 
                         don't fear death.

                                     GENCO
                              (with sly wink)
                         It's been arranged, then?

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         You blaspheme. Resign yourself.

                                     GENCO
                         You need your old Consigliere. Who 
                         will replace me?
                              (suddenly)
                         Stay with me Godfather. Help me meet 
                         death. If he sees you, he will be 
                         frightened and leave me peace. 
                         You can say word, pull few 
                         strings, eh? We'll outwit that bastard 
                         as we outwitted all those others.
                              (clutching his hand)
                         Godfather, don't betray me.

                DON motions all others to leave room. They do.

               He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and 
               whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.

               INT. NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

               DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into embrace.

                                     DON CORLEONE

                                     WOLTZ
                         You should have told me your boss 
                         was Corleone, Tom,  had to check

               They cross garden and head toward stables.

                                     WOLTZ
                         I'm going to show something 
                         beautiful.

               They pass stables, and come to rest by stall with 
               huge bronze plaque attached to outside wall: "KHARTOUM." 
               TWO SECURITY GUARDS positioned chairs nearby; they 
               rise as WOLTZ approaches.

                                     WOLTZ
                         You like horses?  like horses,  
                         love 'em. Beautiful, expensive 
                         Racehorses.

                animal inside truly beautiful. WOLTZ whispers to him 
               with true love his voice.

                                     WOLTZ

                                     HAGEN
                         Mr. Corleone Johnny's Godfather.

               That very close, very sacred religious relationship.

                                     WOLTZ
                         Okay, but just tell him this one 
                         favor  can't give. But he should 
                         try me again anything else.

                                     HAGEN
                         He never asks second favor when he 
                         has been refused first. 
                         Understood?

                                     WOLTZ
                         You smooth son of bitch, let me 
                         lay it line for you, and your 
                         boss. Johnny Fontane never gets that 
                         movie.  don't care how many Dago, 
                         Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come 
                         out of woodwork!

                                     HAGEN
                         I'm German-Irish.

                                     WOLTZ
                         Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny 
                         will never get that part because  
                         hate that pinko punk and I'm going 
                         to run him out of Movies. And 
                         I'll tell why. He ruined one of 
                         Woltz Brothers' most valuable 
                         proteges. For five years  had this 
                         girl under training; singing lessons!  
                         Acting lessons! Dancing lessons! We 
                         spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--
                          was going to make her star. I'll 
                         be even more frank, just to show 
                         that I'm not hard-hearted man, 
                         that it wasn't all dollars and cents. 
                         That girl was beautiful and young 
                         and innocent and she was greatest 
                         piece of ass I've ever had and I've 
                         had them all over world. Then 
                         Johnny comes along with that olive 
                         oil voice and guinea charm and she 
                         runs off. She threw it all away to 
                         make me look ridiculous. A MAN IN MY 
                         POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO 
                         LOOK RIDICULOUS!

               EXT. DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)

               An unimposing little building New York City Mott Street 
               with large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS, INC." next 
               to open-faced fruit market.

               A dark Buick pulls up, and single small man, whom we cannot 
               see well because of distance, gets out and enters 
               building. This VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.

               INT. DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

               Looking toward staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps 
               before he actually rises into view. He small man, very 
               dark, with curly black hair. But wiry, and tight and hard, 
               and obviously very dangerous. He greeted head of 
               stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it, 
               introducing himself. For moment, there complex of 
               handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful 
               introductions. Finally, SOLLOZZO taken into DON's 
               glass paneled office; two principals introduced.  
               They very respectful of one another. Folding chairs 
               brought by FREDDIE, and soon they all sitting around 
               circle; DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE, 
               CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  DON slightest bit foolish 
               with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no 
               one. Throughout all that transpires, however, it clear 
               that this scene between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.

                                     SOLLOZZO

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Why do come to me? Why do

                         more important,  need friend who 
                         has people high places; friend 
                         who can guarantee that if one of my 
                         employees be arrested, they would 
                         get only light sentences. Be my 
                         friend.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         What percentages for my family?

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         Thirty per cent. In first year 
                         your share would be four million 
                         dollars; then it would go up.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         And what percentage of 
                         Tattaglia family?

               SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         My compliments. I'll take care of 
                         them from my share.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         So.  receive 30 per cent just for 
                         finance and legal protection. No 
                         worries about operations, that 
                         what tell me?

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         If think two million dollars 
                         cash just finance,  congratulate 
                         Don Corleone.

               There long silence; which each person present feels 
               tension.  DON about to give his answer.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                          said  would see because I've 
                         heard you're serious man, to be 
                         treated with respect...
                              (pause)
                         But I'll say no to you.

               We feel this around room.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         I'll give my reasons.  have 
                         many, many friends Politics.
                         But they wouldn't be so friendly if 
                         my business was narcotics instead of 
                         gambling. They think gambling 
                         something like liquor, harmless 
                         vice... and they think narcotics 
                         dirty business.

               SOLLOZZO takes breath.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         No... how man makes his living 
                         none of my business. But this 
                         proposition of yours too risky.
                         All people my family lived 
                         well last ten years,  won't 
                         risk that out of greed.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                          worried about security for 
                         your million?

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         No.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                          Tattaglias will guarantee your 
                         investment also.

               This startles SONNY; he blurts out.

                                     SONNY
                          Tattaglia family guarantees our 
                         investment?

               SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face 
               him. Everyone room knows that SONNY has stepped out 
               of line.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Young people greedy, and they 
                         have no manners. They speak when 
                         they should listen. But  have 
                         sentimental weakness for my children, 
                         and I've spoiled them, as see.  
                         But Signor Sollozzo, my no final.

               SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this dismissal. He 
               glances one last time SONNY. He rises; all others do 
               as well. He bows to DON, shakes his hand, and formally 
               takes his leave. When footsteps can no longer be heard:

                DON turns to SONNY.

                                     DON CORLEONE

                         It's from Johnny. It was announced 
                         this morning. He's going to play 
                         lead new Woltz Brothers film.

               INT. DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)

               It large, dominated by huge bed, which man, 
               presumably WOLTZ, sleeping. Soft light bathes room 
               from large windows. We move closer to him until we see 
               his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ. He turns uncomfortably; 
               mutters, feels something strange his bedsheets. Something 
               wet.

               He wakens, feels sheets with displeasure; they wet.  
               He looks his hand; wetness blood. He frightened, 
               pulls aside covers, and sees fresh blood his sheets 
               and pajamas. He grunts, pulls puddle of blood his 
               bed. He feels his own body frantically, moving, down, 
               following blood, until he face to face with great 
               severed head of Khartoum lying foot of his bed. Just 
               blood from hacked neck. White reedy tendons show. He 
               struggles up to his elbows puddle of blood to see 
               more clearly. Froth covers muzzle, and enormous eyes 
               of animal yellowed and covered with blood.

               WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot. No sound comes out.

               Then, finally and suddenly ear-splitting scream of pure 
               terror escapes from WOLTZ, who rocking his hands and 
               knees uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.

               INT. DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

               HAGEN Olive Oil Company office. In background, 
               through glass partitions, we can see DON, work 
               his office. TOM tired, and steeped paperwork.

                                     HAGEN (O.S.)
                         Sure. Anything  can do for you.

                                     MICHAEL (O.S.)
                         No.  guess I'll see Christmas.
                         Everyone's going to be out Long 
                         Beach, right?

                         Right.

               He smiles. MICHAEL has hung up. He looks piles of 
               work, and can't face it. He rises, puts his coat and hat, 
               and continues out.

               He peeks into DON's office.

                                     HAGEN
                         Michael called; he's not leaving New 
                         Hampshire until tomorrow morning.  
                         I've got to go,  promised Theresa 
                         I'd pick up some toys for kids.

                DON smiles and nods.

               TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.  
               FREDDIE sitting bench corner, reading 
               afternoon paper. He puts aside papers office manager 
               has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE, raps his 
               knuckles his head to take his nose out of paper.

                                     DON CORLEONE

                         few minutes.

                                     FREDO
                         I'll have to get it myself; Paulie 
                         called sick this morning.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         That's third time this month.

                think maybe you'd better get healthier bodyguard for me.  
               Tell Tom.

                                     FREDO
                              (going)
                         Paulie's good kid. If he's sick, 
                         he's sick.  don't mind getting 
                         car.

               FREDDIE leaves. He slowly puts his jacket. Looks out his 
               window.

               EXT. DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

               FREDDIE crosses street.

                MANAGER helps him with his overcoat. Once again, 
               DON glances out his window.

                black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.

               And he starts down stairs.

               EXT. DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

                light outside very cold, and beginning to fail. When 
               FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into 
               driver's seat.  DON moves to car, and about to get 
               when he hesitates, and turns back to long, open fruit 
               stand near corner.

                PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.  DON walks among 
               trays and baskets, and merely points to particular piece 
               of fruit. As he selects, MAN gingerly picks pieces 
               of fruit up and puts them into paper bag.  DON pays 
               with five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then turns 
               back to car.

               EXT. DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)

               TOM HAGEN exits carrying stack of presents, all gift 
               wrapped. He continues past windows. As he walks, someone 
               walks right his way. He looks up. It SOLLOZZO.

               He takes TOM by arm and walks along with him.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                              (quietly)
                         Don't be frightened.  just want to 
                         talk to you.

               A car parked curb suddenly flings its rear door open.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                              (urgently)
                         Get in;  want to talk to you.

               HAGEN pulls his arm free. He frightened.

                                     HAGEN
                          haven't got time.

               TWO MEN suddenly appear either side of him.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         Get car. If  wanted to kill 
                         you'd be dead already. Trust me.

               HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving 
               our VIEW Mechanical windows gaily bobbing story 
               of Hansel and Gretel. We HEAR car doors shut, and 
               car drive off.

               EXT. NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)

               RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during Christmas show. KAY and 
               MICHAEL exit; tears still streaming down her cheeks, and 
               she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex. KAY 
               nostalgically hums " Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk 
               arm arm.

                                     KAY
                         Would like me better if  were 
                         nun?

                                     MICHAEL
                         No.

                                     KAY
                         Would like me better if  were 
                         Ingrid Bergman?

               They have passed little enclosed newsstand. KAY sees 
               something that terrifies her. She doesn't know what to do.  
               MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.

                                     KAY
                              (a little voice)
                         Michael?

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'm thinking about it.

                                     KAY
                         Michael...

                                     MICHAEL
                         No,  would not like better if 
                         were Ingrid Bergman.

               She cannot answer him. Rather she pulls him by arm, back 
               to newsstand, and points. His face goes grave.

                headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED 
               DOWN."

               MICHAEL petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops 
               dollar tray, and hungrily reads through them. KAY 
               knows to remain silent.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (desperately)
                         They don't say if he's dead or alive.

               EXT. DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

               DON CORLEONE by fruit stand; he about to move to 
               car, when TWO MEN step from corner. Suddenly, DON 
               drops bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness 
               toward parked car.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Fredo, Fredo!

                paper bag has hit ground, and fruit begins rolling 
               along sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.

               Five bullets catch DON back; he arches pain, 
               and continues toward car.

                PROPRIETOR of fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking 
               over entire case of fruit.

                TWO GUNMEN move quickly, anxious to finish him off.

               Their feet careful to avoid rolling fruit. There 
               more GUNSHOTS.

               FREDDIE hysterical; he tries to get out of car; having 
               difficulty opening door. He rushes out, gun trembling 
               his hand; his mouth open. He actually drops gun.

                gun falls amid rolling fruit.

                GUNMEN panicked. They fire once more downed 
               DON CORLEONE. His leg and arm twitch where they hit; and 
               pools of blood beginning to form.

                GUNMEN obviously state of panic and confusion; 
               they disappear around corner as quickly as they came.

                PEOPLE about avenue have all but disappeared: rather, 
               we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely from 
               around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from windows.  
               But street itself now empty.

               FREDDIE shock; he looks his FATHER; now great puddles 
               of blood have formed, and DON lifeless and face down 
               them.

               FREDDIE falls back to curb and sits there, saying 
               something we cannot understand. He begins to weep profusely.

               INT. NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

               LUCA BRAS riding alone subway car, late night. He 
               gets off.

               He emerges subway terminal, proceeds out.

               EXT. NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)

               LUCA walks down late night street. He approaches 
               elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign still 
               winking this late night. He waits and watches. Then 
               sign goes out; and he proceeds into club.

               INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

                main floor of Nightclub very large, with endless 
               glistening wooden floors. Now, this late time, chairs 
               have been stacked tables and NEGRO JANITOR waxing 
               them. A single HAT-CHECK GIRL counting her receipts. LUCA 
               moves past empty bandstand, and sits bar. ANOTHER 
               MAN, dark and very well-built, moves behind bar.

                                     MAN
                         Luca... I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

                                     LUCA
                          know.

               LUCA looks up; and out of shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         Do know who  am?

               LUCA Nods.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         You've been talking to Tattaglias.  
                         They thought we could do business.

               LUCA listens.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                          need somebody strong to protect my 
                         operation, physically. I've heard 
                         you're not happy with your family, 
                         might make switch.

                                     LUCA
                         If money good enough.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         On first shipment,  can guarantee 
                         fifty thousand dollars.

               LUCA looks him; he had no idea offer would be so good.

               SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it, 
               rather, he busies himself putting cigarette his mouth.  
               BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind bar, makes cigarette lighter 
               magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette. Then, he 
               does odd thing; he drops lighter bar, and puts 
               his hand lightly LUCA's, almost patting it.

               INT. NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

                telephone SONNY's house ringing. He approaches it, 
               obviously fresh from nap.

                                     SONNY
                         Yeah.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Do recognize my voice?

                                     SONNY
                          think so. Detective squad?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Right. Don't say my name, just listen.  
                         Somebody shot your father outside 
                         his place fifteen minutes ago.

                                     SONNY
                          he alive?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                          think so, but  can't get close 
                         enough. There's lot of blood. I'll 
                         try to find out more.

                                     SONNY
                         Find out anything can... got 
                         Grand coming.
                              (click)

               SONNY cradles phone. An incredible rage builds up 
               him, his face actually turning red. He would like to rip 
               phone to pieces his bare hands. Then he controls it.

               Quickly, he dials another number.

                                     SONNY
                         Theresa, let me talk to Tom. Not 
                         yet? Have him call me as soon as he 
                         gets home.

               He hangs up.

                                     SANDRA (O.S.)
                         Sonny? Sonny, who it?
                              (she enters room)
                         What it?

                                     SONNY
                              (calmly)
                         They shot old man.

                                     SANDRA
                         Oh God...

                                     SONNY
                         Honey... don't worry. Nothing else 
                         going to happen.

               There POUNDING door. A BABY starts crying.

                                     SANDRA
                              (really frightened)
                         SONNY?

               SONNY reaches into cabinet drawer, takes out gun, and 
               moves quickly. He opens front door quickly. It 
               CLEMENZA. He enters, SONNY closes door. SANDRA goes to 
               look after baby.

                                     CLEMENZA
                              (excited)
                         You heard about your father?

                                     SONNY
                         Yeah.

                                     CLEMENZA
                          word out streets that 
                         he's dead.

                                     SONNY
                         Where hell was Paulie, why wasn't 
                         he with Don?

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Paulie's been little sick all 
                         winter... he was home.

                                     SONNY
                         How many times did he stay home 
                         last couple of months?

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Maybe three, four times.  always 
                         asked Freddie if he wanted another 
                         bodyguard, but he said no. Things 
                         have been so smooth last ten 
                         years...

                                     SONNY
                         Go get Paulie,  don't care how sick 
                         he is. Pick him up yourself, and 
                         bring him to my father's house.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         That's all? Don't want me to 
                         send some people over here?

                                     SONNY
                         No, just and Paulie.

               CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits couch 
               weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.

                                     SONNY
                         A couple of our people will come to 
                         stay here. Do whatever they say; I'm 
                         going over to main house. If 
                         want me, use Pop's special phone.

                telephone rings again. SONNY answers it.

                                     SONNY
                         Hello.

                                     SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
                         Santino Corleone?

               SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is. SONNY 
               indicates that she be quiet.

                                     SONNY
                         Yeah.

                                     SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
                         We have Tom Hagen. In about three 
                         hours he'll be released with our 
                         proposition. Don't do anything until 
                         you've heard what he has to say. You 
                         can only cause lot of trouble. 
                         What's done done.
                              (a pause)
                         Don't lose that famous temper of 
                         yours.

                                     SONNY
                              (quietly)
                         I'll wait.

               EXT. NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

               FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL. It night, but courtyard 
               bathed with white light from floodlights tops of 
               all houses. It very cold. We see figure of SONNY 
               cross Mall, and let himself into main house.

               INT. NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

               SONNY walks into empty, darkened house. Then he calls 
               out.

                                     SONNY
                         Ma? Ma, where you.

                kitchen door swings open. He moves quickly and takes her 
               by arm. He deliberately calm.

                                     SONNY
                         Ma,  just got call. Pop's hurt... 
                          don't know how bad.

                                     MAMA
                              (quietly)
                         Santino? Have they killed him?

                                     SONNY
                              (almost tears)
                         We don't know yet, Ma.

                                     MAMA
                         I'll get dressed. In case we can see 
                         him...

               She moves out of kitchen, and continues upstairs. SONNY 
               turns gas from pan of peppers she was frying. He 
               takes some bread without thinking, and dips it oil, 
               and sloppily eats some of peppers, as he moves into his 
               father's office.

               INT. NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

               He switches lights DON's office.  massive 
               desk dominates room. SONNY moves quickly to telephone, 
               pulling small chair to side of desk, and dials 
               number.

                                     SONNY
                         Tessio... This Santino Corleone. 
                          want fifty reliable men out here.

                                     TESSIO (O.S.)
                          heard, Sonny... but what about 
                         Clemenza's regime?

                                     SONNY
                          don't want to use Clemenza's people 
                         right now. Understood?

               He hangs up. He moves quickly to wall safe; operates 
               dial, and removes small notebook. He takes it back to 
               desk, and runs over list of numbers with his forefinger.  
               We follow names, until finger stops one: LUCA 
               BRASI. SONNY dials number. There no answer.

                                     SONNY
                         Luca.

               INT. NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)

                interior of abandoned building. SEVERAL MEN suits 
               and ties sit around booths.

               HAGEN sits one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                          know you're not muscle end 
                         of family--so  don't want 
                         to be afraid.  want to help 
                         Corleones and  want to help me.

               HAGEN's hands trembling as he tries to put cigarette 
               his mouth. ONE of BUTTON MEN brings bottle of rye 
               to table, and pours little into delicate, flowered 
               china cup. HAGEN sips gratefully.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         Your boss dead...

               HAGEN overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.

               SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                              (pushing bottle)
                         Have some more. We got him outside 
                         his office, just before  picked 
                         up. You have to make peace between 
                         me and Santino.

               HAGEN still focused grief of losing old man.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
                         You know it's smart thing to do, 
                         too.  want to talk Sonny into 
                         it.

                                     HAGEN
                              (pulling himself 
                              together)
                         Sonny will come after with 
                         everything he's got.

               SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         That's going to be his first reaction.  
                         You have to talk some sense into 
                         him.  Tattaglia family stands 
                         behind me with all their people.  
                         other New York Families will go along 
                         with anything that prevents full 
                         scale war.

               He leans close to HAGEN.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                          Don was slipping; old 
                         days  could never have gotten to 
                         him. Now he's dead, nothing can bring 
                         him back. Talk to Sonny, talk to 
                         Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio... 
                         it's good business.

                                     HAGEN
                         Even Sonny won't be able to call off 
                         Luca Brasi.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         I'll worry about Luca. You take care 
                         of Sonny and other two kids.

                                     HAGEN
                         I'll try... It's what Don would 
                         want us to do.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                              (lifting his hands 
                              expression of 
                              harmlessness)
                         Good... then can go...
                              (he escorts him to 
                              door)
                          don't like violence. I'm 
                         businessman, and blood big 
                         expense.

               He opens door; they step out together.

               EXT. NITE: BUILDING

               HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.

               But car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.  
               He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to 
               SOLLOZZO private.

               Then SOLLOZZO moves with grave expression. He opens 
               door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                          old man still alive. Five 
                         bullets his Sicilian hide and 
                         he's still alive.
                              (he gives fatalistic 
                              shrug)
                         Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.

               EXT. NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

               MICHAEL driving during night. There little fog 
               air, and moisture has formed windshield, making 
               it difficult to see well.  wipers move across view, 
               as gate of Corleone Mall appears before us, still 
               decorated for Christmas.  courtyard bathed with white 
               floodlight, giving this place cold and isolated look.  
               narrow entrance mouth of Mall sealed off with link 
               chain. There strange cars parked along curving cement 
               walk. SEVERAL MEN congregated about gate and chain; 
               ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.

                                     MAN
                         Who're you?

               ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and 
               then turns.

                                     MAN 2
                         It's Don's kid; take car, 
                         I'll bring him inside.

                FIRST MAN opens car door, and MICHAEL steps out.

               INT. NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)

                Hallway of main house filled with MEN MICHAEL 
               doesn't recognize. They pay little attention to him. Most of 
               them waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one talking.

               INT. NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

               MICHAEL moves into living room; there Christmas 
               tree, and countless greeting cards taped to walls.

               THERESA HAGEN sitting stiffly sofa, smoking 
               cigarette; coffee table front of her water 
               glass half filled with whiskey. On other side of 
               sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face impassive, but he sweating, 
               and cigar his hand glistens slickly black with his 
               saliva. PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone other 
               side of room. CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up him.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Your mother's hospital with 
                         old man: He's gonna pull through.

               MICHAEL nods his relief.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Thanks.

               He moves to THERESA.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (gently)
                         You heard from Tom yet?

               Without looking up, she clings to him for moment, and 
               trembles. Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through 
               room; everyone speaks whisper.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (taking her hand)
                         C'mon.

               He leads her into his father's office without knocking.

               INT. NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

               SONNY and TESSIO huddled around yellow pad. They look 
               up, startled.

                                     SONNY
                         Don't worry, Theresa; they just want 
                         to give Tom proposition, then 
                         they're going to turn him loose.

               He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise, 
               he kisses him cheek.

                                     SONNY
                          was worried when we couldn't get 
                         touch with that hick town.

                                     MICHAEL
                         How's Mom?

                                     SONNY
                         Good. She's been through it before.
                         Me too. You were too young to know 
                         about it. You better wait outside; 
                         there're some things shouldn't 
                         hear.

                                     MICHAEL
                          can help out...

                                     SONNY
                         Oh no can't, old man'd be 
                         sore as hell if  let get mixed 
                         up this.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

                                     SONNY
                         Theresa.

               She understands, and leaves them alone.

                                     SONNY
                         All right, Mikey... who do we have 
                         to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

                                     MICHAEL
                         What?

                                     SONNY
                         One of them fingered old man.

               MICHAEL didn't realize that men waiting outside were 
               trial for their lives.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Clemenza? No,  don't believe it.

                                     SONNY
                         You're right, kid, Clemenza okay.
                         It was Paulie.

                                     MICHAEL
                         How can be sure?

                                     SONNY
                         On three days Paulie was sick 
                         this month, he got calls from 
                         payphone across from old man's 
                         building. We got people phone 
                         company.
                              (he shrugs)
                         Thank God it was Paulie... we'll 
                         need Clemenza bad.

               MICHAEL just realizing gravity and extent of 
               situation.

                                     MICHAEL
                          it going to be all-out war, like 
                         last time?

                                     SONNY
                         Until old man tells me different.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Then wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.

                                     SONNY
                         Sollozzo dead man,  don't care 
                         what it costs.  don't care if we 
                         have to fight all five families 
                         New York.  Tattaglia family's 
                         going to eat dirt.  don't care if 
                         we all go down together.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (softly)
                         That's not how Pop would have played 
                         it.

                                     SONNY
                          know I'm not man he was. But 
                         I'll tell this and he'll tell 
                         too. When it comes to real action, 
                          can operate as good as anybody 
                         short range.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (calmly)
                         All right, Sonny. All right.

                                     SONNY
                         Christ, if  could only contact Luca.

                                     MICHAEL
                          it like they say?  he that good?

               Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost scream of relief.  
               Then open door and rush out.

               Everyone standing: doorway, TOM HAGEN wrapped 
               tight embrace with his WIFE.

                                     HAGEN
                         If  plead before Supreme Court, 
                         I'll never do better than  did 
                         tonight with that Turk.

               EXT. NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

                windows of main house dark except for DON's 
               study. It stands out against cold, dark night.

               INT. NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

                living room empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting 
               edge of sofa.  clock reads: 4:00 a.m.

               INT. NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

               SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted, 
               shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep. It four 
               morning; there evidence of many cups of coffee and many 
               snacks. They can barely talk anymore.

                                     HAGEN
                          hospital covered?

                                     SONNY
                          cops have it locked and  got 
                         my people there visiting Pop all 
                         time. What about hit list.

               HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks yellow pad.

                                     HAGEN
                         Too much, too far, too personal.  
                         Don would consider this all purely 
                         business dispute: Get rid of Sollozzo, 
                         and everything falls line. YOU 
                         don't have to go after Tattaglias.

               CLEMENZA nods.

                                     HAGEN
                         What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't 
                         seem worried about Luca. That worries 
                         me.

                                     SONNY
                         If Luca sold out we're real 
                         trouble.

                                     HAGEN
                         Has anyone been able to get touch 
                         with him?

                                     SONNY
                         No, and I've been calling all night.
                         Maybe he's shacked up.

                                     HAGEN
                         Luca never sleeps over with broad.
                         He always goes home when he's through. 
                         Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.

               MICHAEL, very tired, picks up phone, and dials number 
               once again. He can hear phone ringing other end 
               but no one answers. Then hangs up.

                                     HAGEN
                         Keep trying every fifteen minutes.
                              (exhausted)

                                     SONNY
                         Tom, you're Consigliere, what do 
                         we do if old man dies?

                                     HAGEN
                         Without your father's political 
                         contacts and personal influence, 
                         Corleone family loses half its 
                         strength. Without your father, 
                         other New York families might wind 
                         up supporting Sollozzo, and 
                         Tattaglias just to make sure there 
                         isn't long destructive war.  
                         old days over, this 1946; 
                         nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If 
                         your father dies... make deal, 
                         Sonny.

                                     SONNY
                              (angry)
                         That's easy to say; it's not your 
                         father.

                                     HAGEN
                              (quietly)
                          was as good son to him as or 
                         Mike.

                                     SONNY
                         Oh Christ Tom,  didn't mean it that 
                         way.

                                     HAGEN
                         We're all tired...

                                     SONNY
                         OK, we sit tight until old man 
                         can give us lead. But Tom,  
                         want to stay inside Mall.
                         You too, Mike, no chances. Tessio, 
                         hold your people reserve, but 
                         have them nosing around city. 
                          hospital yours;  want it 
                         tight, fool-proof, 24 hours day.

               There timid knock door.

                                     SONNY
                         What it?

               PAULIE GATTO looks in.

                                     CLEMENZA
                          tol' to stay put, Paulie...

                                     PAULIE
                          guy gate's outside... 
                         says there's package...

                                     SONNY
                         Tessio, see what it is.

               TESSIO gets up, leaves.

                                     PAULIE
                         You want me to hang around?

                                     SONNY
                         Yeah. Hang around.

                                     PAULIE
                         Outside?

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Outside.

                                     PAULIE
                         Sure.

               He closes door.

                                     SONNY
                         Clemenza. You take care of Paulie.  
                         don't ever want to see him again. 
                         Understood?

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Understood.

                                     SONNY
                         Okay, now can move your men into 
                         Mall, replace Tessio's people.  
                         Mike, tomorrow take couple of 
                         Clemenza's people and go to Luca's 
                         apartment and wait for him to show. 
                         That crazy bastard might be going 
                         after Sollozzo right now if he's 
                         heard news.

                                     HAGEN
                         Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up 
                         this so directly. You know old 
                         man doesn't want that.

                                     SONNY
                         OK forget it, just stay phone.

               MICHAEL embarrassed to be so protected. He dials Luca 
               Brasi's number once again.  ring repeats, but no one 
               answers.

               TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest 
               his hand. He unwraps it; there large fish wrapped 
               inside.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi sleeps 
                         with fishes.

               INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

               LUCA sits Bar of Tattaglia Nightclub, as we 
               remember him. BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.  
               LUCA looks up him.

               Then SOLLOZZO pats other hand, almost affectionately.

               LUCA just about to twist his hands away, when they both 
               clamp down as hard as they can. Suddenly, garrote thrown 
               around his neck, and pulled violently tight. His face begins 
               to turn to purple blotches, and then totally purple, right 
               before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, far more extreme 
               way than normal tongue could. His eyes bulge.

               ONE of MEN looks down him disgust as LUCA's strength 
               leaves him.

                                     BRUNO
                              (making ugly face)
                         Oh Christ... all over floor.

               SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with victorious smile his 
               face.

               LUCA falls to floor.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                          Godfather next.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

               Morning simple Brooklyn suburb. There rows of 
               pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down block. A 
               dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with 
               noticeable limp down sidewalk, and rings bell. This 
               ROCCO LAMPONE.  woman of house, MRS. CLEMENZA, 
               talks to him through screen door, and then points to 
               side of house. ROCCO moves to garage, which 
               specially heated, and which CLEMENZA busy work 
               washing shiny brand new Lincoln. LAMPONE admires car.

                                     LAMPONE
                         Nice.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Crazy Detroit delivered it with 
                         wooden bumper. They're going to send 
                         me chrome bumpers couple 
                         months.  waited two years for this 
                         car to come with wooden bumpers!

               He scrubs and polishes with great affection.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Today make your bones Paulie.
                         You understand everything?

                                     LAMPONE
                         Sure.

               As he scrubs around glove compartment, he opens it, 
               unwraps gun and gives it to LAMPONE.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         .22 soft-nosed load. Accurate up to 
                         five feet.

               LAMPONE expertly puts gun away. GATTO's car pulls into 
               driveway, and he sounds horn.

                two men walk to car. GATTO driving, bit nervous, 
               like he doesn't know what up. LAMPONE gets rear 
               seat; CLEMENZA front, making grunt of recognition.  
               He looks his wristwatch, as though wanting to chide PAULIE 
               for being late. PAULIE flinches little when he sees LAMPONE 
               will ride behind him; he half turns:

                                     PAULIE
                         Rocco, sit other side. A big 
                         guy like blocks my rearview 
                         mirror.

               CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Goddamn Sonny. He's running scared.
                         He's already thinking of going to 
                         mattresses. We have to find 
                         place West Side. Paulie, 
                         know good location?

               PAULIE relaxes bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook 
               he was on. Also there's money he can make by selling 
               Sollozzo any secret location.

                                     PAULIE
                         I'll think about it.

                                     CLEMENZA
                              (grunting)
                         Drive while thinking;  wanna 
                         get to City this month!

                car pulls out.

               EXT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)

               Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits grump. OUR VIEW 
               does not show LAMPONE rear seat.

               EXT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

                Car crosses to Midtown Tunnel late Winter 
               light.

               INT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

               Inside tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.

               He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch glimpse of 
               him.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Pay attention!

                         Good for ten men...

                                     CLEMENZA
                         OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose 
                         to call when  found somethin'.

                car pulls off.

               EXT. DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

               New part of city; car pulls up parking lot.

               CLEMENZA get outs, glances LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         You wait; I'll call.

               He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around corner 
               and enters Luna Restaurant.

               INT. DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

               CLEMENZA enters little restaurant, sits down table.  
                WAITERS know him; immediately put bottle of wine, some 
               bread--and then plate of veal his table. He eats.

               EXT. DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

               CLEMENZA exits restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants; 
               he well fed.

               We move with him around corner, not knowing what to expect 
               has happened to Paulie.

               There car; PAULIE still sitting behind wheel, 
               LAMPONE rear seat. CLEMENZA steps in.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         He talked my ear off. Want us to go 
                         back to Long Beach; have another job 
                         for us. Rocco, live City, 
                         can we drop off?

                                     LAMPONE (O.S.)
                         Ah,  left my car your place.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         OK, then gotta come back.

                car pulls out. By now, PAULIE completely relaxed and 
               secure.

                                     PAULIE
                         You think we'll go for that last 
                         place?

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Maybe, or gotta know now.

                                     PAULIE
                         Holy cow,  don't gotta know nothing.

               EXT. DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)

                car moves along ready beach area of causeway.

               Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Paulie, pull over.  gotta take 
                         leak.

                car pulls off Causeway, into reeds. CLEMENZA 
               steps out of car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.

               He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer 
               see car), unzips, and we hear sound of urine hitting 
               ground. We wait this for moment; and then there 
               two GUNSHOTS. CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and turns, 
               moving back to car.

               PAULIE dead, bleeding from mouth; windows behind 
               him shattered.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Leave gun.

               LAMPONE gets out, two men walk through reeds few 
               feet where there another car. They get in, and drive off.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

               HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL. It late afternoon. Many strange 
               cars parked nearby streets. We can see group 
               of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries 
               with concealed weapons.

               MICHAEL walks along rear yard.

               He bundled warm marine coat. He looks strange 
               men, regarding them with uncertain awe. They look back 
               him, first suspiciously and then with respect of his 
               position. He like exile Prince. He wanders past them, 
               and hesitates and looks yard.

               A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground 
               equipment.  basketball ring now half coming off. This 
               where he was child. Then shout.

                                     CLEMENZA (O.S.)
                         Mike. Hey Mikey; telephone.

               CLEMENZA had shouted from kitchen window. MICHAEL hurries 
               into house.

               INT. DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

               CLEMENZA kitchen, cooking over enormous pot.  
               He points to kitchen wall phone which hanging off 
               hook.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Some dame.

               MICHAEL picks it up.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Hello. Kay?

                                     KAY (O.S.)
                         How your father?

                                     MICHAEL
                         He'll be OK.

                                     KAY (O.S.)
                              (pause)
                          love you.

               He glances THUGS kitchen. Tries to shield 
               phone.

                                     KAY (O.S.)
                          LOVE YOU.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Yeah Kay, I'm here.

                                     KAY (O.S.)
                         Can say it?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Huh?

                                     KAY (O.S.)
                         Tell me love me.

               MICHAEL glances HOODS kitchen table. He curls 
               up corner, and quarter voice:

                                     MICHAEL
                          can't...

                                     KAY (O.S.)
                         Please say it.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Look. I'll see tonight, OK?

                                     KAY (O.S.)
                         OK.
                              (click)

               CLEMENZA getting ready to build tomato sauce for all 
               button men stationed around house.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         How come don't tell that nice 
                         girl love her... here, learn 
                         something... may have to feed 
                         fifty guys some day. You start with 
                         olive oil... fry some garlic, see.  
                         And then fry some sausage... or meat 
                         balls if like... then throw 
                         tomatoes, tomato paste... 
                         some basil; and little red wine... 
                         that's my trick.

               SONNY peeks into kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.

                                     SONNY
                         You take care of Paulie?

                                     CLEMENZA
                         You won't see Paulie anymore. He's 
                         sick for good this winter.

               MICHAEL starts to leave.

                                     SONNY
                         Where going?

                                     MICHAEL
                         To city.

                                     SONNY
                              (to Clemenza; dipping 
                              bread into sauce)
                         Send some bodyguards.

                                     MICHAEL
                          don't need them, Sonny. I'm just 
                         going to see Pop hospital.
                         Also,  got other things.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Sollozzo knows Mike's civilian.

                                     SONNY
                         OK, but be careful.

               EXT. NITE: CAR

               MICHAEL sits rear seat, calmly, as he being driven 
               into city. THREE BUTTONMEN crowded into front 
               seat.

               INT. NITE: HOTEL LOBBY

               MICHAEL crosses lobby, past lines of servicemen trying 
               to book rooms.

               INT. NITE: HOTEL

               MICHAEL and KAY eating quiet dinner hotel. He 
               preoccupied, she's concerned.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Visiting hour ends eight thirty.
                         I'll just sit with him;  want to 
                         show respect.

                                     KAY
                         Can  go to hospital with you?

                                     MICHAEL
                          don't think so. You don't want to 
                         end up page 3 of Daily News.

                                     KAY
                         My parents don't read Daily News.  
                         All right, if think  shouldn't.  
                          can't believe things papers 
                         printing. I'm sure most of it's 
                         not true.

                                     MICHAEL
                          don't think so either.
                              (silence)
                          better go.

                         Hampshire... think things over.

                         Goodbye.

               Quietly, he moves out door.

               KAY lies bed while, and then, to herself:

                                     KAY
                         Goodbye.

               EXT. NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

               A taxi pulls up front of hospital, marked clearly with 
               neon sign "HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY." MICHAEL steps out, pays 
               fare... and then stops dead his tracks.

               MICHAEL looks.

               He sees hospital night; but it deserted. He 
               only one street. There gay, twinkling Christmas 
               decorations all over building. He walks, slowly first, 
               and then ever so quickly, up steps. He hesitates, looks 
               around. This area empty. He checks address scrap 
               of paper. It correct. He tries door, it empty.

               He walks in.

               INT. NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)

               MICHAEL stands center of absolutely empty hospital 
               lobby. He looks to right; there long, empty corridor.  
               To left: same.

               HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through desolated 
               building lit by eerie green neon lighting. All we hear 
               his sole footsteps.

               He walks up to desk marked "INFORMATION". No one there.  
               He moves quickly to door marked "OFFICE"; swings into it; 
               no one there. He looks onto desk: There half 
               sandwich, and half-filled bottle of coke.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Hello? Hello?

               Now he knows something happening, he moves quickly, 
               alertly. MICHAEL walking down hospital corridors; all 
               alone.  floors have just been mopped. They still wet.

               Now he turns onto staircase; ever quickening; up several 
               flights.

               INT. NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

               He steps out onto fourth floor. He looks. There merely 
               empty corridors. He takes out his scrap of paper; checks it.  
               "Room 4A." Now he hurries, trying to follow code of 
               hospital rooms; following right arrows, quicker and 
               quicker they flash by him. Now he stops, looks up "4A-- 
               Corleone".

               There special card table set up there with some 
               magazines... and some smoking cigarettes still ashtray--
               but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.

               INT. NITE: DON'S ROOM

               Slowly he pushes door open, almost afraid what he 
               will find. He looks. Lit by moonlight through window, 
               he can see FIGURE hospital bed alone room, 
               and under transparent oxygen tent. All that can be heard 
               steady though strained breathing. Slowly MICHAEL walks 
               up to it, and relieved to see his FATHER, securely asleep.  
               Tubes hang from steel gallows beside bed, and run to 
               his nose and mouth.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         What doing here?

               This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around. It NURSE 
               lit from light behind her hallway.

                                     NURSE
                         You're not supposed to be here now.

               MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'm Michael Corleone--this my 
                         father. What happened to 
                         detectives who were guarding him?

                                     NURSE
                         Oh your father just had too many 
                         visitors. It interfered with 
                         hospital service.  police came 
                         and made them all leave just ten 
                         minutes ago.
                              (comfortingly)
                         But don't worry.  look him.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You just stand here one minute...

               Quickly he moves to telephone, dials number.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Sonny... Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm 
                         down hospital.  came down 
                         late. There's no one here. None of 
                         Tessio's people--no detectives, no 
                         one.  old man completely 
                         unprotected.

                                     SONNY (O.S.)
                         All right, get him different 
                         room; lock door from inside.
                         I'll have some men there inside of 
                         fifteen minutes. Sit tight, and don't 
                         panic.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (furiously, but kept 
                              inside)
                          won't panic.

               He hangs up; returns to NURSE...

                                     NURSE
                         You cannot stay here... I'm sorry.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (coldly)
                         You and  going to move my father 
                         right now... to another room 
                         another floor... Can disconnect 
                         those tubes so we can wheel bed 
                         out?

                                     NURSE
                         Absolutely not! We have to get 
                         permission from Doctor.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You've read about my father 
                         papers. You've seen that no one's 
                         here to guard him. Now I've just 
                         gotten word that men coming to 
                         this hospital to kill him. Believe 
                         me and help me.

                                     NURSE
                              (frightened)
                         We don't have to disconnect them, we 
                         can wheel stand with bed.

               She does so... and they perform very difficult task of 
               moving bed and apparatus, out of room.

               INT. NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

               They roll bed, stand, and all tubes silently 
               down corridor. We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up stairs.  
               MICHAEL hears them, stops.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Hurry, into there.

               They push it into first available room. MICHAEL peeks 
               out from door.  footsteps louder; then they emerge.  
               It ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying bouquet of flowers.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (stepping out)
                         Who it?

                                     ENZO
                         Michael... do remember me, Enzo, 
                         baker's helper to Nazorine, now 
                         his son-in-law.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Enzo, get out of here. There's going 
                         to be trouble.

               A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

                                     ENZO
                         If there... will be trouble...  
                         stay with you, to help.  owe it to 
                         Godfather.

               MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all help he can get.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Go outside; stand front... I'll 
                         be out minute.

               INT. NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

               They part. MICHAEL moves into hospital room where they 
               put his FATHER.

                                     NURSE
                              (frightened)
                         He's awake.

               MICHAEL looks OLD MAN, his eyes open, though he 
               cannot speak. MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Pop... Pop, it's me Michael. Shhhh, 
                         don't try to speak. There men 
                         who coming to try to kill you.
                         But I'm with you... I'm with 
                         now...

                OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot. MICHAEL tenderly 
               puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.

               EXT. NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)

               Outside hospital empty save for nervous ENZO, pacing 
               back and forth brandishly flowers as his only weapon.  
               MICHAEL exits hospital and moves to him. They both stand 
               under lamppost cold December night. They both 
               frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO cigarette, lights it. ENZO's 
               hands trembling, MICHAEL's not.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Get rid of those and look like you've 
                         got gun your pocket.

                windows of hospital twinkle with Christmas 
               decorations.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Listen...

               We HEAR sound of single automobile coming. MICHAEL and 
               ENZO look with fear their eyes. Then MICHAEL takes 
               bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.

               They stand, hands their pockets.

               A long low black car turns corner and cruises by them.

               MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces tough, impassive.  car 
               seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.

               MICHAEL and ENZO relieved. MICHAEL looks down; BAKER's 
               hands shaking. He looks his own, and they not.

               Another moment goes by and we can hear distant sound of 
               police sirens. They clearly coming toward hospital, 
               getting louder and louder. MICHAEL heaves sigh of relief.

               In second, patrol car makes screaming turn front of 
               hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed 
               POLICE and DETECTIVES. He smiles his relief and starts toward 
               them. TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his arms while 
               ANOTHER frisks him. A massive POLICE CAPTAIN, spattered with 
               gold braid and scrambled eggs his hat, with beefy red 
               face and white hair seems furious. This McCLUSKEY.

                                     MCCLUSKEY
                          thought  got all guinea hoods 
                         locked up. Who hell and 
                         what doing here?

               ANOTHER COP standing nearby:

                                     COP
                         He's clean, Captain.

               MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (quietly)
                         What happened to detectives who 
                         were supposed to be guarding my 
                         father?

                                     MCCLUSKEY
                              (furious)
                         You punk-hood. Who hell 
                         to tell me my business.  pulled 
                         them off.  don't care how many Dago 
                         gangsters kill each other.  wouldn't 
                         lift finger to keep your old man 
                         from getting knocked off. Now get 
                         hell out of here; get off this 
                         street punk, and stay away from 
                         this hospital.

               MICHAEL stands quiet.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'll stay until put guards around 
                         my father's room.

                                     MCCLUSKEY
                         Phil, lock this punk up.

                                     A DETECTIVE
                          Kid's clean, Captain... He's 
                         war hero, and he's never been mixed 
                         up rackets...

                                     MCCLUSKEY
                              (furious)
                         Goddam it,  said lock him up. Put 
                         cuffs him.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (deliberately, right 
                              to McCLUSKEY's face, 
                              as he's being 
                              handcuffed)
                         How much Turk paying to 
                         set my father up, Captain?

               Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL 
               squarely jaw with all his weight and strength. MICHAEL 
               groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw. He looks McCLUSKEY; 
               we his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and he falls 
               to ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S MEN arrive.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

               HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  gateway now has 
               long black car blocking it. There more BUTTON MEN 
               stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying 
               rifles; those of houses close to courtyard have MEN 
               standing by open windows. It clear that war 
               escalating. A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE, 
               MICHAEL and HAGEN. MICHAEL's jaw wired and bandaged. He 
               stops and looks up open window. We can see MEN holding 
               rifles.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Christ, Sonny really means business.

               They continue walking. TESSIO joins them.  various 
               BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         How come all new men?

                                     TESSIO
                         We'll need them now. After 
                         hospital incident, Sonny got mad.
                         We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock 
                         this morning.

               INT. DAY: DON'S HALLWAY

               They enter house past scores of new and strange faces.

               INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

               SONNY DON's office; he excited and exuberant.

                                     SONNY
                         I've got hundred button men 
                         streets twenty-four hours day. If 
                         Sollozzo shows one hair his ass 
                         he's dead.

               He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face his hand, 
               kiddingly.

                                     SONNY
                         Mikey, look beautiful!

                                     MICHAEL
                         Cut it out.

                                     SONNY
                          Turk wants to talk!  nerve of 
                         that son of bitch! After he craps 
                         out last night he wants meet.

                                     HAGEN
                         Was there definite proposal?

                                     SONNY
                         Sure, he wants us to send Mike to 
                         meet him to hear his proposition.
                          promise deal will be so 
                         good we can't refuse.

                                     HAGEN
                         What about that Tattaglias? What 
                         will they do about Bruno?

                                     SONNY
                         Part of deal: Bruno cancels out 
                         what they did to my father.

                                     HAGEN
                         We should hear what they have to 
                         say.

                                     SONNY
                         No, no Consiglere. Not this time.
                         No more meetings, no more discussions, 
                         no more Sollozzo tricks. Give them 
                         one message:  WANT SOLLOZZO. If 
                         not, it's all out war. We go to 
                         mattresses and we put all button 
                         men out street.

                                     HAGEN
                          other families won't sit still 
                         for all out war.

                                     SONNY
                         Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.

                                     HAGEN
                         Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't 
                         want to hear this. This not 
                         personal thing, this Business.

                                     SONNY
                         And when they shot me father...

                                     HAGEN
                         Yes, even shooting of your father 
                         was business, not personal...

                                     SONNY
                         No no, no more advice how to patch 
                         it up Tom. You just help me win.  
                         Understood?

               HAGEN bows his head; he deeply concerned.

                                     HAGEN
                          found out about this Captain 
                         McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's 
                         definitely Sollozzo's payroll, 
                         and for big money. McCluskey's agreed 
                         to be Turk's bodyguard. What 
                         have to understand that while 
                         Sollozzo guarded like this, he's 
                         invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned 
                         down New York Police Captain. Never. 
                         It would be disastrous. All five 
                         families would come after Sonny; 
                         Corleone family would be outcasts; 
                         even old man's political 
                         protection would run for cover. So 
                         just... take that into consideration.

                                     SONNY
                              (still fuming)
                         McCluskey can't stay with Turk 
                         forever. We'll wait.

                                     MICHAEL
                         We can't wait. No matter what Sollozzo 
                         say about deal, he's figuring out 
                         how to kill Pop. You have to get 
                         Sollozzo now.

                                     SONNY
                          kid's right.

                                     HAGEN
                         What about McCluskey?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Let's say now that we have to kill 
                         McCluskey. We'll clear that up through 
                         our Newspaper contacts later.

                                     SONNY
                         Go Mike.

                                     MICHAEL
                         They want me to go to conference 
                         with Sollozzo. Set up meeting 
                         for two days from now. Sonny, get 
                         our informers to find out where 
                         meeting will be held. Insist it has 
                         to be public place: bar or 
                         restaurant height of dinner 
                         hour. So I'll feel safe. They'll 
                         check me when  meet them so  won't 
                         be able to carry weapon; but 
                         Clemenza, figure out way to have 
                         one planted there for me.
                              (pause)
                         Then I'll kill them both.

               Everyone room astonished; they all look MICHAEL.  
               Silence. SONNY suddenly breaks out laughter. He points 
               finger MICHAEL, trying to speak.

                                     SONNY
                         You? You, high-class college 
                         kid. You never wanted to get mixed 
                         up family business. Now 
                         wanta gun down police Captain and 
                         Turk just because got slapped 
                         face. You're taking it 
                         personal, it's just business and 
                         he's taking it personal.

               Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO also smiling; only HAGEN keeps 
               his face serious.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (angrily, but cold)
                         Sonny, it's all personal, and  
                         learned it from him, old man, 
                         Godfather. He took my joining 
                         Marines personal.  take Sollozzo 
                         trying to kill my father personal, 
                         and know I'll kill them Sonny.

               MICHAEL radiates danger... SONNY stops laughing.

               INT. DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)

               CLOSE revolver.

                                     CLEMENZA (O.S.)
                         It's as cold as they come, impossible 
                         to trace.
                              (he turns it upside 
                              down)
                         Don't worry about prints Mike,  put 
                         special tape trigger and 
                         butt. Here.
                              (he hands gun to 
                              another pair of hands)
                         Whatsamatter? Trigger too tight.
                              (it fires: very LOUD)
                          left it noisy, so it'll scare any 
                         pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander 
                         away.

               MICHAEL alone with CLEMENZA cellar workshop.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Just let your hand drop to your side, 
                         and let gun slip out. Everybody 
                         will still think got it. They'll 
                         be starin' your face, see? Then 
                         walk out of place real fast, but 
                         don't run. Don't look anybody directly 
                         eye, but don't look away from 
                         them neither. Hey, they'll be scared 
                         stiff o' you, believe me. Nobody's 
                         gonna bother with you. Don't worry 
                         about nothing; you'd be surprised 
                         how good these things go.  O.K., put 
                         your hat on, let's see how look. 
                         Helps with identification.

               They put hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Mostly it gives witnesses excuse 
                         to change their identification when 
                         we make them see light. Then 
                         take long vacation and we catch 
                         hell.

                                     MICHAEL
                         How bad will it be?

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Probably all other families will 
                         line up against us. But, it's alright.  
                         These things have to happen once 
                         every ten years or so... gets rid of 
                         bad blood. You gotta stop 'em 
                         beginning. Like they shoulda 
                         stopped Hitler Munich, they shoulda 
                         never let him get away with that, 
                         they were just asking for big 
                         trouble...

               INT. DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

               MICHAEL steps into foyer of main house. A card table 
               set up with man playing cards with three of Corleone 
               buttonmen.

               He continues into living room. It's mess. SONNY asleep 
               sofa. On coffee table remains of take-
               out Chinese food dinner, and half-empty bottle of whisky.  
                radio playing.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Why don't stop living like bum 
                         and get this place cleaned up.

                                     SONNY
                         What you, inspecting barracks?
                              (SONNY sits up with 
                              his head his hands)
                         You ready? Did Clemenza tell be 
                         sure to drop gun right away?

                                     MICHAEL
                         A million times.

                                     SONNY
                         Sollozzo and McCluskey going to 
                         pick up hour and half 
                         Times Square, under big Camels 
                         sign.

                                     HAGEN
                         We don't let Mike go until we have 
                         hostage, Sonny.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         It's okay... hostage outside 
                         playing pinochle with three of my 
                         men.

                phone rings DON's office.

                                     SONNY
                         That could be Tattaglia informer 
                         with meeting place.

               INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

               HAGEN has hurried into Den to get phone; OTHERS 
               move in.

               HAGEN's phone; he writes something down.

                                     SONNY
                         One of Tattaglia's people?

                                     HAGEN
                         No. Our informer McCluskey's 
                         precinct. Tonight 8:00 he signed 
                         out for Louis' Restaurant 
                         Bronx. Anyone know it.

                                     TESSIO
                         Sure,  do. It's perfect for us. A 
                         small family place with big booths 
                         where people can talk private. 
                         Good food. Everybody minds their 
                         business. Perfect.
                              (he moves to desk 
                              and makes crude 
                              drawing)
                         This entrance, Mike. When 
                         finish just walk out and turn left, 
                         then turn corner. Clemenza, 
                         gotta work fast to plant gun.  
                         They got old-fashioned toilet 
                         with space between water 
                         container and wall. We can tape 
                         gun behind there.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Mike, they're gonna frisk 
                         car. You'll be clean so they won't 
                         worry 'bout nothing. In 
                         restaurant, wait and talk while, 
                         and then ask permission to go. See?
                         Then when come out, don't waste 
                         time; don't sit down... come out 
                         blasting. And don't take chances. In 
                         head, two shots apiece. And out 
                         as fast as your legs can move.

                                     SONNY
                          want somebody very good, very safe 
                         to plant that gun.  don't want my 
                         brother coming out of that toilet 
                         with just his dick his hand.

                                     CLEMENZA
                          gun will be there.

                                     SONNY
                              (to MICHAEL, warmly)
                         You're on, kid... I'll square it 
                         with Mom your not seeing her before 
                         left. And I'll get message to 
                         your girl friend when  think 
                         time right.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         We gotta move...

                                     MICHAEL
                         O.K. How long do think before  
                         can come back?

                                     SONNY
                         Probably year...

                                     HAGEN
                              (starting to crack)
                         Jesus,  don't know...

                                     SONNY
                         Can do it Mike?

               MICHAEL moves out.

               EXT. NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)

                enormous "CAMELS" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands 
               MICHAEL, dressed warm overcoat, and wearing hat 
               CLEMENZA had given him. A long black car pulls around 
               corner and slows before him.  DRIVER, leaning over, open 
               front door.

                                     DRIVER
                         Get in, Mike.

               He does, car drives off.

               EXT. NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

               Inside car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over back seat 
               and shakes MIKE's hand.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         I'm glad came, Mike.  hope we 
                         can straighten everything out. All 
                         this terrible, it's not way  
                         wanted things to happen all. It 
                         should never have happened.

                                     MICHAEL
                          want to settle things tonight.  
                         want my father left alone.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         He won't be;  swear to be my 
                         children he won't be. Just keep 
                         open mind when we talk.  hope you're 
                         not hothead like your brother, 
                         Sonny. It's impossible to talk 
                         business with him.

               McCLUSKEY grunts.

                                     MCCLUSKEY
                         He's good kid. He's all right. 
                         Turn around, up your knees, facing 
                         me.

               He gives MICHAEL thorough frisk.

                                     MCCLUSKEY
                         I'm sorry about other night Mike.  
                         I'm getting too old for my job, too 
                         grouchy. Can't stand aggravation.  
                         You know how it is. He's clean.

               EXT. NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)

               MICHAEL looks DRIVER and then ahead to see where 
               they're heading.

                car takes George Washington Bridge. MICHAEL 
               concerned.

                                     MICHAEL
                         We're going to New Jersey?

                                     SOLLOZZO
                              (sly)
                         Maybe.

               MICHAEL closes his eyes.

               EXT. NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)

                car speeds along George Washington Bridge its way 
               to New Jersey. Then suddenly it hits divider, temporarily 
               lifts into air, and bounces over into lanes going 
               back to New York. It then hits it very fast, way back 
               to city.

               EXT. NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

               SOLLOZZO checks to see cars that had been following, and 
               then leans to DRIVER.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         Nice work; I'll remember it.

               MICHAEL relieved.

               EXT. NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

                car pulls up front of little family restaurant 
               Bronx:  "LUNA AZURA". There no one street. 
               MICHAEL looks to see if DRIVER going to get out with 
               them. He gets out, and opens door. SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY 
               and MICHAEL get out; DRIVER remains leaning against 
               car. They enter restaurant.

               INT. NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

               A very small family restaurant with mosaic tile floor.  
               SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around rather small 
               round table near center of room. There empty 
               booths along side walls; with handful of CUSTOMERS, 
               and ONE or TWO WAITERS. It very quiet.

                                     MCCLUSKEY
                          Italian food good here?

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         Try veal; it's finest New 
                         York.

                solitary WAITER brings bottle of wine to table.

               They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three 
               glasses. Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:

                                     SOLLOZZO
                          going to talk Italian to Mike.

                                     MCCLUSKEY
                         Sure, two go right ahead; I'll 
                         concentrate my veal and my 
                         spaghetti.

               SOLLOZZO now begins rapid Sicilian. MICHAEL listening 
               carefully and nodding every so often. Then MICHAEL answers 
               Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  WAITER occasionally 
               brings food; and they hesitate while he there; then go 
               on.

               Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself Italian, 
               accidentally lapses into English.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (using English for 
                              emphasis)
                         Most important...  want sure 
                         guarantee that no more attempts will 
                         be made my father's life.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         What guarantees can  give you?  
                         hunted one. I've missed my chance.  
                         You think too highly of me, my 
                         friend...  not so clever... all 
                          want truce...

               MICHAEL looks long and hard SOLLOZZO, who smiling 
               holding his open hands up as if to say: " have no tricks up 
               my sleeve". Then he looks away and makes distressed look 
               his face.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         What it?

                                     MICHAEL
                          it all right if  go to 
                         bathroom?

               SOLLOZZO intuitively suspicious. He studies MICHAEL with 
               his dark eyes. Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's thigh 
               feeling and around, searching for weapon.

                                     MCCLUSKEY
                          frisked him; I've frisked thousands 
                         of young punks; he's clean.

               He looks MAN sitting table opposite them; indicating 
               bathroom with his eyes.  MAN nods, indicating no one 
               there.

                                     SOLLOZZO
                         Don't take too long.

               MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to bathroom, and 
               disappears inside.

               INT. NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)

               MICHAEL steps into small bathroom; he breathing very 
               hard. He actually uses urinal. Then he washes his hands 
               with bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly. Then 
               he moves to booth, up to old-fashioned toilet.

               Slowly he reaches behind water tank; he panics when he 
               cannot feel gun. We see behind tank his hand just 
               few inches from gun... he gropes searchingly... finally 
               coming to rest gun.

               CLOSE ON MICHAEL; feel of it reassures him. Then he breaks 
               it loose from tape holding it; he takes deep breath 
               and shoves it under his waistband. For some unexplainable 
               reason he hesitates once again, deliberately washes his hands 
               and dries them. Then he goes out.

               INT. NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

               He hesitates by bathroom door; and looks his table.

               McCLUSKEY eating plate of spaghetti and veal. SOLLOZZO 
               turns around upon hearing door, and looks directly 
               MICHAEL. MICHAEL looks back. Then he smiles and continues 
               back to table. He sits down.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Now  can talk.  feel much better.

                MAN by far wall had been stiff with attention; now 
               he too relaxes. SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down 
               comfortably and his hands move under table and unbutton 
               his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak Sicilian once again 
               but MICHAEL's heart pounding so hard he can barely hear 
               him.

                WAITER comes to ask about order, SOLLOZZO turns to 
               speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves table away 
               from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts 
               gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his 
               temple. He pulls trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's 
               head blown away, and spray of fine mist of blood cover 
               entire area.

                WAITER looks amazement; suddenly his white jacket 
               sprayed and stained with blood.

               SOLLOZZO seems perpetual fall to floor; through he 
               seems to hang space suspended.

               MICHAEL pivots, and looks:

               There McCLUSKEY, frozen, fork with piece of veal 
               suspended air before his gaping mouth.

               MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY his thick bulging throat.  
               He makes horrible, gagging, choking sound. Then coolly, 
               and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right through 
               McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.

                air filled with pink mist. MICHAEL swings toward 
               MAN standing by bathroom wall.

               He does not make move, seemingly paralyzed.

               Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.

                WAITER steps backward through mist of blood, 
               expression of horror his face.

               MICHAEL looks his two victims:

               SOLLOZZO still his chair, side of his body propped up by 
               table.

               McCLUSKEY finally falls from chair to table.

               MICHAEL wildly peak. He starts to move out. His hand: 
               frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.

               He moves, not letting gun go.

               MICHAEL's face; frozen its expression.

               His hand: still holding gun.

               His face: finally he closes his eyes.

               His hand relaxes, gun falls to floor with dull 
               thud.

               He walks quickly out of restaurant, looks back.

               He sees frozen tableau of murder; as though it had 
               been recreated wax.

               Then he leaves.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

               A MAN his shirtsleeves plays sentimental tune old 
               upright piano, while his cigarette burns edge.

               ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.

               A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around crude table, 
               quietly eating. They talk low, relaxed voices, and there 
               occasional laugh.

               ROCCO LAMPONE stands by window, which has been covered 
               with heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.

               A large bowl of pasta passed, and MEN eat heartily.

                sentimental tune continued over following:

               INT. DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)

               Ten mattresses spread out around otherwise empty 
               living room of apartment. THREE or FOUR MEN including 
               CLEMENZA, taking naps.

               An arsenal of hand guns spread out card table.

                MEN table continue their dinner; passing and

               ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked blood, lies spanning 
               three steps of front stoop.

               A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes letter.

               Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.

               Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.

               A MAN by table pulls cork another bottle of 
               Ruffino, and wine poured as MEN eat.

               A neatly stacked pile of newspapers corner of 
               apartment. We catch glimpse of one headline: "Five Family 
               War..."

                table.  MEN sitting around cracking nuts. ONE has 
               fallen asleep his arms table.

               EXT. DAY: MANCIN BLDG. (SPRING '46)

               Several cars parked front of pleasant New York 
               apartment building. We recognize couple of SONNY's 
               bodyguards loafing by cars, pitching playing cards against 
               curb.

               Inside building, two others wait quietly by rows of 
               brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.

               Up one flight of stairs, single man sits step, 
               smoking cigarette.

               One of men by mailboxes checks his pocketwatch, which 
               attached to key chain. We HEAR sound of door 
               opening; they look up.

                man sitting stop stands; and looks.

               SONNY backs out of apartment, arms of LUCY MANCIN 
               wrapped around him. She doesn't want to let go of him; she 
               draws him back into apartment for moment, and then he 
               comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.

               He jauntily skips down steps, trailed by bodyguard 
               first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  
               men quickly take up their positions. As he gets his car:

                                     DRIVER
                         Pick up your sister?

                                     SONNY
                         Yeah.

                car drives off; accompanied and escorted by bodyguards 
               their cars.

               INT. DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)

               He knocks door. No answer. Then again.

                                     CONNIE'S VOICE
                         Who it?

                                     SONNY
                         It's me, Sonny.

               We hear bolt slide back, and see door open. SONNY 
               enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into hallway, her 
               back to him.

                                     SONNY
                              (tenderly)
                         Connie, what it?

               He turns her around his arms.

               Her face swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her 
               rough, red eyes that she has been crying for long time.  
               As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red 
               with rage. She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing 
               him from running out of apartment.

                                     CONNIE
                              (desperately)
                         It was my fault!  started fight 
                         with him and  tried to hit him so 
                         he hit me. He didn't even try to hit 
                         me hard Sonny,  walked into it.

               Sonny listens, and calms himself. He touches her shoulder, 
               thin silk robe.

                                     SONNY
                         I'm goin' to have doctor come 
                         over and take look you.

               He starts to leave.

                                     CONNIE
                         Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.
                         Please don't.

               He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.

                                     SONNY
                         Hey. Con. What'm  goin' to do? Make 
                         your kid orphan before he's born.

               She laughs with him. He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.

               EXT. DAY: CONNIE'S STREET

               CARLO settles down front steps of 112th St. "Book" 
               with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking beer out 
               of glasses and pitcher of beer from around corner.  
               ball game blaring from radio; and kids 
               street still playing stickball.

               CARLO has barely settled down, when kids street 
               suddenly scatter, and car comes screeching up block 
               and to halt front of candy store.  tires scream, 
               and before it seems as though it has even stopped, MAN 
               comes hurtling out of driver's seat, moving so fast 
               everyone paralyzed. It moment before we recognize 
               that it SONNY.

               His face contorted with anger; split second he 
               stoop and has CARLO by throat.

               He pulls CARLO away from others, trying to get him down 
               into street. But CARLO reaches out for iron railing, 
               and hangs on, his hand lock, cringing away, trying to 
               hide his head and face hollow of his shoulders. 
               His shirt ripped away SONNY's hand.

               SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.

               SONNY pounding cowered CARLO with all his strength, 
               continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing. His 
               blows powerful; and begin to draw blood.

                kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching 
               fascination.

               CARLO's hands clenched tight around railing.

               SONNY beats him mercilessly.

               Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become 
               spectators.

               SONNY's tight fists going down like hammers, into CARLO's 
               face and body.

               CARLO's nose bleeding profusely; but still he does nothing, 
               other than hang onto railing.

               SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag 
               him off of hold railing, his teeth clenched 
               effort. Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands; 
               even biting them. CARLO screams but he does not let go.

               It's clear that CARLO much stronger than he is, and will 
               not be moved. SONNY knees him mouth, and beats him 
               more; but he exhausted. Totally out of breath, he stammers 
               haltingly to bleeding CARLO.

                                     SONNY
                         You... bastard... You... hurt my 
                         sister... again... and I'll kill... 
                         you.

               He wipes sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly 
               and hurries back to car, moment his car gone, 
               leaving even his bodyguards confusion. We notice ONE MAN 
               with sports jacket group of spectators especially 
               interested.

               CARLO finally relaxes clenched, locked hands. He slumps 
               onto stoop.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

               HIGH ANGLE Corleone Mall. It gray, rainy day.  
               Young BUTTON MEN raincoats stand quiet groups of various 
               points around main house and compound. Things have 
               changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; new and 
               secure gate house has been built. Security measures that had 
               been make-shift and temporarily have now been made permanent 
               part of Mall, evolving it into Medieval Fortress. We 
               notice huge crater courtyard; result of recent 
               bomb attempt.  house nearest crater damaged by 
               fire.

               A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled bright 
               yellow raincoat; she lets cab go, and hurries to 
               shelter of gate house.

               They not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they 
               call main house.

               KAY looks imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still 
               runs down onto her face.

               She notices bomb crater, and fire damage; and 
               sullen faces of BUTTON MEN.

               TOM HAGEN exits Main House, and hurries toward her.

                                     HAGEN
                         Kay, we weren't expecting you. You 
                         should call...

                                     KAY
                         I've tried calling and writing.  
                         want to reach Michael.

                                     HAGEN
                         Nobody knows where he is. We know 
                         he's all right, but that's all.

               KAY looks direction of crater, filling with 
               rainwater.

                                     KAY
                         What was that?

                                     HAGEN
                         An accident. No one was hurt.

                                     KAY
                         Listen Tom,  let my cab go; can  
                         come to call another one?

               TOM clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has 
               to.

                                     HAGEN
                         Sure... I'm sorry.

               They hurry through rain and into Main House.

               INT. DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

               In living room, KAY shakes water from her coat and 
               takes her rainhat off.

                                     KAY
                         Will give this to him.

                                     HAGEN
                         If  accept that letter and told 
                         Court of Law  accepted it, they 
                         would interpret it as my having 
                         knowledge of his whereabouts. Just 
                         wait Kay, he'll contact you.

               We hear footsteps descending staircase; MAMA CORLEONE 
               enters room; OLD WOMAN squints KAY, evaluating 
               her.

                                     MAMA
                         You're Mikey's little girl.

               KAY nods yes; there still tears her eyes.

                                     MAMA
                         You eat anything?

               KAY shakes her head.

                                     MAMA
                              (to HAGEN)
                         Disgrazia, don't even give 
                         poor girl cup of coffee?

               HAGEN shrugs helplessly; impulse, KAY quickly moves 
               toward MAMA, letter extended.

                                     KAY
                         Will give this letter to Michael.

                                     HAGEN
                         Mama, no.

                                     MAMA
                         You tell me what to do? Even he don't 
                         tell me what to do.

               She takes letter from KAY, who grateful and relieved.

                                     KAY
                         Why did they blame Michael?

                                     MAMA
                         You listen to me, go home to 
                         your family, and find good 
                         young man and get married. Forget 
                         about Mikey; he's no good for you, 
                         anymore.

               She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what 
               that means.

               CARLO sits alone among them, frown his face.

                                     CONNIE
                         What's matter, Carlo?

                                     CARLO
                         Shut up.

               INT. DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

               All MEN of family stand around hospital bed with 
               grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to OLD MAN.  DON 
               does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and 
               glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized. HAGEN 
               spokesman for family.

                                     HAGEN
                         ...since McCluskey's killing, 
                         police have cracked down most of 
                         our operations... other 
                         families too. There's been lot of 
                         bad blood.

                OLD MAN glances SONNY.

                                     SONNY
                         Pop, they hit us and we hit them 
                         back.

                                     HAGEN
                         We put out lot of material through 
                         our contacts Newspapers... 
                         about McCluskey's being tied up with 
                         Sollozzo Drug Rackets... things 
                         starting to loosen up.

                OLD MAN nods.

                                     SONNY
                         Freddie's gonna go to Las Vegas... 
                         under protection of Don Francesco 
                         of L.A.  want him to rest...

                                     FREDO
                         I'm goin' to learn casino 
                         business.

                DON nods approvingly. Then he searches around room 
               for face he does not see. HAGEN knows who he's looking 
               for.

                                     HAGEN
                         Michael...
                              (he takes breath)
                         It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

                DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them anger and 
               rage.

                                     HAGEN
                         He's safe now... we're already working 
                         ways to bring him back.

                DON very angry, he motions with weak hand that they 
               leave him alone.

               INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)

               HAGEN very upset as he comes down Stairs; SONNY 
               expansive and optimistic.

                                     SONNY
                         We'll let old man take it easy 
                         for couple of weeks.  want to get 
                         things going good before he gets 
                         better. What's matter with you?

                                     HAGEN
                         You start operating, five families 
                         will start their raids again. We're 
                         stalemate Sonny, your war 
                         costing us lot of money.

                                     SONNY
                         No more stalemate Tom, we got 
                         soldiers, we'll match them gun for 
                         gun if that's how they want it. They 
                         know me for what  am, Tom--and 
                         they're scared of me.

                                     HAGEN
                         Yes. That's true, you're getting 
                         hell of reputation.

                                     SONNY
                         Well it's war! We might not be in
                         this shape if we had real war-time 
                         Consiglere, Sicilian. Pop had Genco, 
                         who do  have?
                              (TOM starts to leave)
                         Hey Tom, hey... hey. It's Sunday, 
                         we're gonna have dinner. Don't be 
                         sore.

               INT. DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

                FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around table 
               over Sunday dinner. SONNY head of table.

               EXT. DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

               SOME of CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play enclosed Mall, 
               proximity of BUTTON MEN stationed liberally by 
               gate.

               ONE CHILD misses ball, it rolls by gate house. A young 
               BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)

               CONNIE and CARLO's apartment. She's slip, phone.  
               We HEAR shower going bathroom.

                                     CONNIE
                         Who this?

                                     GIRL (O.S.)
                              (giggle)
                         I'm friend of Carlo's.  just wanted 
                         to tell him  can't see him tonight; 
                          have to go out of town.

               CONNIE's face turns red.

                                     CONNIE
                         You lousy tramp bitch.
                              (click)

               She slams phone down; just as CARLO coming out of 
               bathroom drying his golden body.

                                     CARLO
                         What was that?

                                     CONNIE
                         Your girl friend. She says she can't 
                         make it tonight. You lousy bastard 
                         have nerve to give your whores 
                         my telephone number. I'll kill you, 
                         bastard!

               She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then 
               she flings herself him, kicking and scratching; her heavy 
               belly heaving under thin slip.

                                     CARLO
                              (defending himself)
                         You're crazy. She was kidding around; 
                          don't know, some nut.

               He pushes her aside, and moves into bedroom to continue 
               dressing.

                                     CONNIE
                         You're staying home. You're not going 
                         out.

                                     CARLO
                         OK, OK. You gonna make me something 
                         to eat least?

               That calms her down; she stands there moment, breathing 
               heavily; and then she nods, and goes into kitchen, and 
               starts her wifely duties.

               CARLO dressed; puts some cologne; CONNIE appears 
               doorway.

                                     CONNIE
                          food table.

                                     CARLO
                         I'm not hungry yet.

                                     CONNIE
                         Eat it, it's table.

                                     CARLO
                         Ba Fa Goulle.

                                     CONNIE
                         BA FA GOULE YOU!

               She turns deliberately, goes out into kitchen. A moment 
               later we begin to hear sound of dishes breaking. CARLO 
               slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically 
               smashing all dishes against sink, sending greasy 
               veal and peppers all over apartment floor.

                                     CARLO
                         You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean 
                         it up or I'll kick your head in.

                                     CONNIE
                         Like hell  will.

               She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again. Slowly, 
               he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it 
               his hand.

                                     CARLO
                         Clean it up!

               He swings belt against her heavy hips. She moves back 
               into kitchen, and gets kitchen knife, and holds it 
               ready.

                                     CARLO
                         Even female Corleones 
                         murderers.

               He puts strap down table, and moves after her. She 
               makes sudden thrust his groin, which he avoids. He pulls 
               knife away, cutting his hand process. She gets 
               away momentarily, but he pursues her around table, gets 
               her; and starts to slap her face.

               She breaks away from him, and rushes into bedroom.

                                     CONNIE
                          baby!  baby!

               INT. DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

               She runs into bedroom; he follows. She moves into 
               corner, and then like desperate animal, tries to hide under 
               bed.

               He reaches under, and pulls her out by hair.

               He slaps her face until she begins to weep; then he 
               throws her bed, contemptuously. He grabs part of her 
               thigh, pinching it very hard.

                                     CARLO
                         You're fat as pig.

               Then he pushes her away, and walks out of room, leaving 
               her tears. She crying; she pulls herself to bedroom 
               phone, and whisper:

                                     CONNIE
                         Mama... mama, it's Connie. Mama,  
                         can't talk any louder. No,  don't 
                         want to talk to Sonny.

               We can tell that phone has been passed to SONNY.

               INT. DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)

               In kitchen Mall, MAMA cannot understand 
               whispering and she has given phone to SONNY.

                                     SONNY
                         Yeah Connie.

                                     CONNIE (O.S.)
                         Sonny, just send car to bring me 
                         home. I'll tell then, it's nothing 
                         Sonny, don't come. Send TOM, 
                         please Sonny, it's nothing;  just 
                         want to come home.

               SONNY's face turning red.

                                     SONNY
                              (in controlled voice)
                         You wait there. You just wait there.

               He hangs up phone; and just stands there for moment.

                                     SONNY
                              (quietly)
                         That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...

               HAGEN enters room; he knows what happening, knows he 
               cannot interfere.

               EXT. DAY: MALL

               SONNY leaves house. HAGEN moves to outside mall just 
               as SONNY's car driving off. He moves to group of BUTTON 
               MEN.

                                     HAGEN
                         Go after him.

               EXT. DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)

               SONNY's car Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.  
               After pause, another car, with CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, 
               trailing.

               SONNY driving; he very angry.

               EXT. NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

               SONNY his car; driving back. Still breathing hard and 
               still furious. Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.

               He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to 
               toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with coin to 
               COLLECTOR.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT

                serious-faced UNDERTAKER telephone.

                                     HAGEN (O.S.)
                         This Tom Hagen. I'm calling for 
                         Don Corleone, his request.

               BONASERA looks his WIFE, with deep anxiety his eyes.  
               BONASERA's lips suddenly dry.

                                     BONASERA
                         Yes,  understand. I'm listening.

                                     HAGEN (O.S.)
                         You owe Don service. In one 
                         hour, not before, perhaps later, he 
                         will be your funeral parlor to 
                         ask for your help. Be there to greet 
                         him. If have any objections speak 
                         now, and I'll inform him.

               Silence. BONASERA stutters, then speaks fright.

                                     BONASERA
                         Anything... Anything Godfather 
                         wishes.

                                     HAGEN (O.S.)
                         Good. He never doubted you.

                                     BONASERA
                          Don himself coming to me 
                         tonight?

                                     HAGEN (O.S.)
                         Yes.
                              (click)

               BONASERA sweating; slowly he lowers phone; his WIFE 
               sees his pale expression, and follows him into room.

               Silently, he begins ritual of dressing. His WIFE knows 
               something serious happening, and never takes her eyes 
               from him. He lights cigarette.

                                     BONASERA
                         For last year, they have been 
                         killing one another. So now, what?
                         Your Godfather comes to me... Why?
                              (whispering, slyly)
                         They've killed someone so important 
                         that they wish to make his body 
                         disappear.

                                     MRS. BONASERA
                              (frightened)
                         Amerigo!

                                     BONASERA
                         They could make me accomplice to 
                         their murder. They could send me to 
                         jail!

               He slips into his trousers. Then he moves to his WIFE to tie 
               his tie, as she has done for years.

                                     BONASERA
                         And if other families find out... 
                         they will make me their enemy. They 
                         could come here to our house.  curse 
                         day  ever went to Godfather.

               EXT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

               With his ring of keys, he opens funeral parlor, enters.

               INT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

               BONASERA walks through darkened funeral parlor, without 
               turning lights; then into rear, preparation room, 
               past tables, and equipment. He operates chain that 
               lifts large overhead garage type door. And looks out into 
               alley.

               He sits bench, and waits.

               EXT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)

                tires of car roll very quietly along small alley; 
               we notice dark car approach rear of BONASERA's funeral 
               parlor.

               CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to open, rear door. BONASERA 
               greets him, too petrified to speak. He notices TWO OTHER MEN 
               get out of car, and carry stretcher with CORPSE 
               swaddled gray blanket, with yellowed feet protruding.

               BONASERA closes his eyes fear, but indicates which way 
               MEN should carry their sinister burden.

               INT. NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

               They carry CORPSE to one of tables embalming 
               room.

               Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of 
               darkness somewhat uncertainly. It DON CORLEONE.

               He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking. His 
               cold eyes looking directly frightened UNDERTAKER.

               Then, after long gaze:

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Well my friend, ready to do 
                         me this service?

               BONASERA nods.  DON moves to CORPSE embalming 
               table; he makes gesture, and OTHER MEN leave them alone.

                                     BONASERA
                         What do wish me to do?

                                     DON CORLEONE
                              (staring table)
                          want to use all your powers, 
                         all your skill, as love me.  do 
                         not want his mother to see him as he 
                         is.

               He draws down gray blanket.

               BONASERA lets out gasp of horror what he sees:

                bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.

               EXT. NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

               SONNY extends his hand with coin toll booth.

               A car suddenly swerves front of him, trapping him 
               booth, and incredible rally of machine gun fire greets 
               him, coming through and smashing windows of toll 
               booths both side of him, and from front window of 
               car blocking him.

                windows of his car shot out.

               Bullet holes puncture doors of his car.

               His hand, with coin it, falls inside car.

               His arms, shoulders riddled by fire, and still it 
               continues, as though ASSASSINS cannot take chance that 
               he will survive it.

               Suddenly, he lets out enormous ROAR, like bull, and 
               actually, opens door, and steps out of car, UNDER 
               fire.

               His face hit; and finally he falls to ground.

               A FULL SHOT... as ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and 
               make off distance.

               SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop safe distance away, realizing they 
               too late.

               INT. NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

               View HAGEN's ashen face living room. He silent 
               moment, and then:

                                     HAGEN
                              (quietly)
                         OK. Go to Clemenza's house and tell 
                         him to come here right away. He'll 
                         tell what to do.

                MEN leave him alone. He quiet, standing middle 
               of living room moment. He looks direction of 
               kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA moving around.

               INT. NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)

               TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly direction of 
               DON's room. He opens DON's door. Looks in.

               INT. NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

                DON his hospital bed. Asleep under sedation. HAGEN 
               hesitates. He cannot go in; he cannot tell OLD MAN. He 
               closes door.

               INT. NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)

               HAGEN alone office. He drinking. He looks up 
               sound of cars; CAPOREGIMES arriving. Then he 
               hears footsteps.

                door opens; and robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE 
               slowly enters room. He walks directly to his stuffed 
               armchair, sits down. His face stern, as he looks into 
               HAGEN's eyes.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Give me drop of anisette.

               HAGEN rises, and pours glass for OLD MAN.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         My wife was weeping before she fell 
                         asleep, outside my window  saw my 
                         caporegimes to house, and it 
                         midnight. So, Consigliere of mine,  
                         think should tell your Don what 
                         everyone knows.

                                     HAGEN
                              (quietly)
                          didn't tell Mama anything.  was 
                         about to come up and wake and 
                         tell you. Just now.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         But needed drink first.

                                     HAGEN
                         Yes.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Now you've had your drink.

               Pause.

                                     HAGEN
                         They shot Sonny Causeway.
                              (pause)
                         He's dead.

               DON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for second he 
               loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands front of 
               him top of desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                          want no inquiries made. No acts of 
                         vengeance.
                              (pause)
                         Consigliere, arrange meeting with 
                         heads of five families... 
                         this war stops now.

               He rises and unsteadily leaves room, turns...

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Call Bonasera... he will do me 
                         service.

               And leaves. HAGEN moves to phone; dials...

                                     HAGEN
                         This Tom Hagen; I'm calling for 
                         Don Corleone, his request.

                                     BONASERA (O.S.)
                         Yes,  understand I'm listening.

                                     HAGEN
                         You owe Don service. He has no 
                         doubt that will repay it.

               EXT. DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)

               Day Manhattan. An impressive Bank Building financial 
               center of New York. Many limousines parked, uniforms and 
               plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.

               INT. DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)

                Board Room of bank, daylight shines windows.

               CARLO TRAMONTI, impressive, handsome middle-aged man, 
               sits quietly, smoking Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to 
               MAN sitting to his left, and little to rear, and settles 
               JOSEPH ZALUCHI, moon-faced amiable-looking man; as 
               view continues, around table, we HEAR:

                                     DON CORLEONE (O.S.)
                          want to thank all for coming.
                          consider it service done to me 
                         personally and  debt of 
                         each and every one of you. Especially 
                         those of who have traveled from 
                         such distances as California, St. 
                         Louis, Kansas City; and New Orleans...

                VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both 
               younger than any of others; then to DOMENICK PANZA, 
               short and squat sitting wheelchair; then around 
               table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who whispering to his 
               JEWISH ASSISTANT; VIEW PASSES to ANTHONY STRACCI, 
               older man, sipping from drink and smoking cigar; OTTILIO 
               CUNEO, his middle sixties with jolly round face; then 
               DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, delicate older man with dyed hair 
               and pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, his 
               early sixties, man to 'respect'; whom we had seen 
               CONNIE's Wedding.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Ah well, let's get down to business.
                         We all honorable men here, we 
                         don't have to give assurances as if 
                         we were lawyers.
                              (he sits, gazes out 
                              them, and sighs)
                         How did things ever go so far? Well, 
                         no matter. A lot of foolishness has 
                         come to pass. It was so unfortunate, 
                         so unnecessary.

                VIEW examines room once again, as DON speaks. A 
               large, clicking board changing numbers various times, 
               and two tapes, showing fluctuations of Market during 
               day's trading, and projected above.

               DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him cold drink.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Tattaglia has lost son;  have 
                         lost son. We quits. Let there 
                         be peace...
                              (he gestures 
                              expressively, 
                              submissively, with 
                              his hands)
                         That all  want...

                                     BARZINI
                         Don Corleone too modest. He had 
                         judges and politicians his 
                         pocket and he refused to share them.
                         His refusal not act of 
                         friend. He takes bread out of 
                         mouths of our families. Times 
                         have changed, it's not like old 
                         days where everyone can go his own 
                         way. If Don Corleone had all 
                         judges and politicians New York, 
                         then he must share them or let others 
                         use them. Certainly he can present 
                         bill for such services, we're not 
                         Communists, after all. But he has to 
                         let us draw water from well. 
                         It's that simple.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         My friends,  didn't refuse out of 
                         malice. You all know me. When have  
                         ever refused accommodation? But 
                         why, this time? Because  think this 
                         drug business will destroy us 
                         years to come. It's not like whiskey 
                         or gambling or even women which most 
                         people want and forbidden them by 
                         pezzonovante of Church and 
                         Government. But drugs? No. Even 
                         policemen, who help us gambling 
                         and other things would refuse to 
                         help us drugs. But...  willing 
                         to do whatever all of think 
                         necessary.

                                     DON ZALUCHI
                          don't believe drugs. For years 
                          paid my people extra so they 
                         wouldn't do that kind of business... 
                         $200 week. But it didn't matter.  
                         Somebody comes to them and says, " 
                         have powders, if put up three, 
                         four thousand dollar investment, we 
                         can make fifty thousand distributing."  
                         Who can resist such profit? There's 
                         no way to control it, as business... 
                         to keep it respectable.
                              (rapping table)
                          don't want it near schools!  don't 
                         want it sold to children. That 
                         infamita.
                              (thinking)
                         In my city  would try to keep 
                         traffic dark people, 
                         colored. They best customers, 
                         least troublesome, and they 
                         animals anyway. They have no respect 
                         for their wives or their families or 
                         themselves. Let them lose their souls 
                         with drugs. But something has to be 
                         done, we can't have everybody running 
                         around doing just what they please, 
                         like bunch of anarchists.

                                     BARZINI
                         Then, we agreed; traffic 
                         drugs will be permitted, but 
                         controlled; and Don Corleone agrees 
                         to give it protection East.

               DON CORLEONE nods.

                                     BARZINI
                         That's whole matter then, we 
                         have peace, and let me pay my 
                         respects to Don Corleone, whom we 
                         have all known over years as 
                         man of his word.
                              (noticing TATTAGLIA 
                              uneasy)
                         Don Philip?

                                     TATTAGLIA
                          agree to everything here, I'm 
                         willing to forget my own misfortune.
                         But  must hear strict assurance 
                         from Corleone. When time goes by and 
                         his position becomes stronger, will 
                         he attempt any individual vengeance?

               They all look DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that 
               DON CORLEONE has given great deal, and must have something 
               else mind. Slowly DON rises.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                          forego my vengeance for my dead 
                         son, for common good. But  have 
                         selfish reasons. My youngest son had 
                         to flee, accused of Sollozzo's murder, 
                         and  must now make arrangements so 
                         that he can come home with safety, 
                         cleared of all those false charges.  
                         That my affair, and  will make 
                         those arrangements.
                              (with strength)
                         But  superstitious man... and 
                         so if some unlucky accident should 
                         befall my youngest son, if some police 
                         officer should accidentally shoot 
                         him, or if he should hang himself 
                         his cell, or if my son struck by 
                         bolt of lightning, then  will 
                         blame some of people here. That, 
                          could never forgive, but... aside 
                         from that, let me swear by souls 
                         of my Grandchildren that  will never 
                         be one to break peace we 
                         have made.

               EXT. NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)

                DON's black limousine. He sits quietly padded 
               rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.

               It night. Lights flash by them every so often.

                                     HAGEN
                         When  meet with Tattaglia's people; 
                         should  insist that all his drug 
                         middle-men be clean?

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Mention it, don't insist. Barzini 
                         man who will know that without 
                         being told.

                                     HAGEN
                         You mean Tattaglia.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                              (shaking his head)
                         Barzini.

                                     HAGEN
                              (a revelation)
                         He was one behind Sollozzo?

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Tattaglia pimp. He could never 
                         have outfought Santino. But  wasn't 
                         sure until this day. No, it was 
                         Barzini all along.

                black limousine speeds away from us night.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT

               A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and 
               downcast, left side of his face healed, but left grotesque 
               and misshapen.

               GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears warm navy Pea jacket, 
               and walks with his hands his pockets.

               THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing Sicilian SHEPHERD 
               either side of him, each carrying shotgun slung over his 
               shoulder, CALO, squat and husky young man with simple 
               honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable, 
               and with pleasing build. Each of SHEPHERDS carry 
               knapsacks.

                THREE YOUNG MEN continue over Sicilian landscape, 
               overlooking impressive view of land and sea.

               EXT. DAY: SICILY ROAD

                THREE move through flock of wind-blown sheep, and make 
               their way to dusty rural road. We HEAR rinky horn sound, 
               as pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them. An 
               OLD MAN peeks from window, waving to MICHAEL.  car 
               pulls front of them and stops. MICHAEL nods respectfully.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Don Tommassino.

                                     DON TOMMASSINO
                         Michael, why must do this. We 
                         have been lucky so far, all these 
                         months you've been here we've kept 
                         your name secret. It from love 
                         for your father that I've asked 
                         never to more than hour from 
                         Villa.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Calo and Fabrizzio with me; 
                         nothing will happen.

                                     DON TOMMASSINO
                         You must understand that your Father's 
                         enemies have friends Palermo.

                                     MICHAEL
                          know.

                                     DON TOMMASSINO
                         Where going?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Corleone.

                                     DON TOMMASSINO
                         There nothing there. Not anymore.

                                     MICHAEL
                          was told that my Grandfather was 
                         murdered its main street; and his 
                         murderers came to kill my father 
                         there when he was twelve years old.

                                     DON TOMMASSINO
                         Long ago. Now there nothing: 
                         men killed each other family 
                         vendettas... others escaped to 
                         America.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Don Tommassino...  should see this 
                         place.

               DON TOMMASSINO thinks moment, then concedes.

                                     DON TOMMASSINO
                         That your birthright... but 
                         Michael, use this car.

                                     MICHAEL
                         No...  would like to walk to 
                         Corleone.

                OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.

                                     DON TOMMASSINO
                         Be careful Michael, don't let them 
                         know your name.

                old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues 
               his journey.

               EXT. DAY: COUNTRYSIDE

                THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit 
               trees, bloom and bursting with life.

               EXT. DAY: VILLAGE

               They continue empty streets of little town; 
               post-war poverty evident skinny dogs; and empty 
               streets. Occasionally, military vehicle, only gasoline-
               powered vehicles road, will pass. And there many 
               POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.

                THREE pass under enormous banner slung over main 
               road "VOTA COMMUNISTA".

               EXT. DAY: COUNTRY ROAD

               They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally 
               donkey pulling cart, or lone horseman will pass them.

               EXT. DAY: FIELD

               Out field, distance, they come upon procession 
               of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong, 
               marching, and singing, and lead, five or six men 
               carrying billowing red banners.

               EXT. DAY: GROVE

               They orange grove; other side of trees 
               deep, tall field of wild flowers.

                Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out 
               loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.

               MICHAEL rests against tree, and uses his handkerchief.

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         You tell us about America.

                                     MICHAEL
                         How do know  come from America?

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         We hear. We were told were 
                         Pezzonovanta... big shot.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Only son of Pezzonovanta.

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         Hey America!  she as rich as they 
                         say?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Yes.

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         Take me to America! You need good 
                         lupara America?
                              (pats his shotgun)
                         You take me, I'll be best man 
                         got. "Oh say, can seeee... 
                         By da star early light..."

               MICHAEL laughs.

               EXT. DAY: ANOTHER ROAD

                TRIO continues down dirt road, as American Military 
               convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of 
               U.S. drivers, as they move by.

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         America. Hey America! Take me with 
                         you! Hey, take me to America G.I.!

               EXT. DAY: CORLEONE HILL

               They continue their long hike, high promontory; until 
               they hesitate, and look down.

                                     CALO
                         Corleone.

               They can see grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.

               EXT. DAY: CORLEONE STREET

               MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through empty streets of 
               village. They walk behind him, and spread to either side 
               about fifteen feet away from him.

               They move down ancient steps, past old stone fountain.  
               MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.

               They go on.

               They move up very narrow old street. MICHAEL looks 
               doorways that they pass.

               MOVING VIEW: Each door has plaque, with ribbon or flower.

               CALO sees MICHAEL looking.

                                     CALO
                          names of dead.

               MICHAEL hesitates center of main street. He looks.

                street empty, barren. Occasionally, old woman will 
               pass.

               MICHAEL turns his head.

                other side of street: empty and deathly.

               A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing center of old 
               street, shepherds respectful distance away.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE

               A green ribboned field of baronial Estate. Further ahead 
               villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been 
               discovered ruins of Pompeii. There group of young 
               village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS, dressed 
               black. They have been gathering pink sulla, purple 
               wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon blossoms. 
               They singing, off distance as they work.

               MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO silent as they watch this 
               Fantasy-like scene.

                                     FABRIZZIO
                              (calling out to them)
                         Hey, beautiful girls!

                                     MICHAEL
                              (sternly)
                         Shhhhh.

               He settles down to watch.

                GIRLS dressed cheap gaily painted frocks that 
               cling to their bodies. They still their teens, but 
               developed and womanly.

               They moving along fields, picking blossoms, not aware 
               of three men watching them from orange grove.

               Three or four of girls begin chasing one of them 
               playfully, direction of grove.

                GIRL being chased holds bunch of purple grapes her 
               left hand and with right, picks more grapes, and throws 
               them back her pursuers laughing.

               They come closer and closer. Just short of grove, she 
               poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching 
               view of THREE MEN. She stands there her toes about to 
               run.

               MICHAEL sees her; now face to face. He looks.

               Her face. Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair 
               and rich mouth.

                                     FABRIZZIO
                              (murmuring)
                         Jesus Christ, take my soul. I'm dying.

               Quickly, she turns, and runs away.

               MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her. We hold 
               him for long while; and eventually hear SHEPHERDS 
               laughing. Then he turns to them.

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         You got hit by thunderbolt, eh?

               CALO pats him shoulder.

                                     CALO
                         Easy man.

                                     MICHAEL
                         What talking about?

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         You can't hide it when you're hit by 
                         thunderbolt.

               EXT. DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE

                little village built attendant to Baronial Estate, 
               decked with flowers girls had been picking.

               MICHAEL, followed by bodyguards, moves into central 
               square, and onto balcony of little cafe.

                proprietor of cafe, VITELLI, short burly man; 
               he greets them cheerfully, and sets dish of chickpeas 
               their table.

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         You know all girls this town, 
                         eh? We saw some beauties coming down 
                         road. One particular got our 
                         friend hit with Thunderbolt...
                              (he indicates MICHAEL)

               VITELL gives big knowing laugh, and looks MICHAEL with 
               new interest.

                                     VITELLI
                         You had better bring few bottles 
                         home with you, my friend; you'll 
                         need help sleeping tonight.
                              (he laughs)

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         This one could seduce devil. A 
                         body! and eyes as big and black as 
                         olives.

                                     VITELLI
                              (laughing with them... 
                              pouring more wine)
                          know about what mean!

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         This was beauty. Right, Calo?

                                     VITELLI
                              (laughing)
                         Beautiful all over, eh?

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         And hair. Black and curly, like 
                         doll. And such mouth.

               VITELL does not laugh quite so much.

                                     VITELLI
                         Yes, we have beautiful girls here... 
                         but virtuous.

               VITELL no longer drinking with them.

                                     MICHAEL
                         She wore red dress, and red ribbon 
                         her hair. She looks more Greek 
                         than Italian. Do know beauty 
                         like that?

               As MICHAEL describes her, VITELL laughed less and less, 
               until he wears scowl.

                                     VITELLI
                         No.

               Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into back room.

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         God Heaven,  think  understand...

               He goes into back room after innkeeper. Then he 
               returns.

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         Let's get out of here; he's boiling 
                         up his blood to do us mischief. It's 
                         his daughter.

               They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.

                                     CALO
                         Come quickly.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Innkeeper. More wine!

                                     FABRIZZIO
                              (whispered)
                          old bastard mentioned two sons 
                         he only has to whistle up.

               MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Tell him to come to me.

                two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear 
               moment they return with red-faced angry VITELL between 
               them.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (quietly)
                          understand I've offended by 
                         talking about your daughter.  offer 
                         my apologies, I'm stranger 
                         this country,  don't know customs 
                         very well. Let me say this,  meant 
                         no disrespect to or her...

               CALO and FABRIZZIO impressed.

                                     VITELLI
                              (shrugs)
                         Who and what do want 
                         from my daughter?

                                     MICHAEL
                          American hiding Sicily 
                         from police of my country. My 
                         name Michael. You can inform 
                         police and make your fortune but 
                         then your daughter would lose father 
                         rather than gain husband. In any 
                         case,  want to meet your daughter. 
                         With your permission and under 
                         supervision of your family. With all 
                         decorum. With all respect.  
                         honorable man.

               CALO and FABRIZZIO stupefied; VITELL pauses, and then 
               asks:

                                     VITELLI
                          friend of friends?

                                     MICHAEL
                         When proper time comes, I'll 
                         tell everything that wife's 
                         father should know.

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         It's real Thunderbolt, then.

                                     VITELLI
                              (formally)

                         Vitelli and my house up there 
                         hill, above village.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Your daughter's name?

                                     VITELLI
                         Appolonia.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

               MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed new clothes from 
               Palermo, and carrying stack of wrapped gifts, gets into 
               Alfa Romeo. CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed their Sunday 
               best, rear seat, huddled together, with their 
               luparas their shoulders.

               DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as little car drives off, 
               rocky and bouncing dirt road.

                Sunday churchbells ring.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               MOTHER, who given gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.  
               Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully appropriate 
               Sunday clothing. Now he presents wrapped gift to 
               APPOLONIA. She looks her MOTHER, who with nod gives her 
               permission to open it. She unwraps it. Her eyes light

               She looks him.

                                     APPOLONIA
                         Grazia.

               Now little Alpha drives into village near VITELLI's 
               cafe.

               MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS, 
               though they all dressed differently.

               They go up to cafe... and sit with VITELLI, who talking 
               and talking.

               MICHAEL looks APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.

               She wears gold necklace around her neck.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               MICHAEL and APPOLONIA walking through hilltop path, 
               seemingly alone, although respectful distance apart.

               As VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and 
               half dozen AUNTS twenty paces behind them, and ten paces 
               further behind CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas their 
               shoulders.

               Further up hill, APPOLONIA stumbles loose stone, 
               and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm. She modestly regains 
               her balance, and they continue walking.

               Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               same feeling and texture as it might have been five 
               hundred years ago.

               grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               buildings, carrying luparas.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               INT. NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA

               MICHAEL opens shutters his darkened room; moonlight 
               fills room.

               He turns, and there, her wedding slip, APPOLONIA. A 
               little frightened; but lovely.

               He moves to her; and for moment just stands before her, 
               looking her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.

               Slowly and tenderly he kisses her. Her tiny hands come up to 
               his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.

               She lets her bridal slip fall to floor.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA

               Morning. MICHAEL sits window ledge, gazing into 
               room.

               APPOLONIA asleep; she naked, and only partially covered 
               by bedsheets.

               He looks her for long time early morning light.

               EXT. DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

               HIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA

               We HEAR girlish laughter; little Alpha driving 
               erratically, knocking down occasional wall, and almost 
               hitting inner court wall.

               APPOLONIA laughing, driving. MICHAEL pretends to be 
               frightened, as he teaches her to drive.

               Outside walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking 
               guard duty.

                car stops and laughing MICHAEL gets out.

                                     MICHAEL
                         It's safer to teach English.

                                     APPOLONIA
                         Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 
                         Friday... See,  learned it. Now 
                         teach me to drive!

               DON TOMMASSINO enters Courtyard. He seems tired and 
               concerned.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Ciao, Don Tommassino.

               APPOLONIA kisses him.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Things went badly Palermo?

                                     DON TOMMASSINO
                          younger men have no respect. 
                         Things changing;  don't know 
                         what will happen. Michael, because 
                         of wedding, people now know your 
                         name.

                                     MICHAEL
                          that why there more men 
                         walls?

                                     DON TOMMASSINO
                         Even so,  don't think it safe 
                         here anymore. I've made plans to 
                         move to villa near Siracuse.
                         You must go right away.

                                     MICHAEL
                         What it?

                                     DON TOMMASSINO
                         Bad news from America. Your brother, 
                         Santino. He has been killed.

               For moment, whole world of New York, Sollozzo, 
               Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.

               EXT. DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

               Morning. MICHAEL leans out of bedroom window.

               Below, FABRIZZIO sitting one of garden chairs, 
               combing his thick hair.

               MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Get car. I'll be leaving ten 
                         minutes. Where's Calo?

                                     FABRIZZIO
                         Calo having cup of coffee 
                         kitchen.  your wife coming 
                         with you?

                                     MICHAEL
                         No, she's going home to her family.
                         She'll join me few weeks...

               INT. DAY: VILLA KITCHEN

               MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from hallway, and into 
               kitchen. CALO just finishing bite. He rises when he 
               sees MICHAEL.

                                     CALO
                         Should  get your bag?

                                     MICHAEL
                         No, I'll get it. Where's Appolonia?

                                     CALO
                              (smiling)
                         She sitting driver's seat 
                         of car, dying to step 
                         gas. She'll be real American woman 
                         before she gets to America.

               MICHAEL smiles.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me 
                         car.

               He leaves kitchen, after quick sip of coffee.

               He looks out from opening doorway.

               EXT. DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

               There car, with APPOLONIA sitting driver's 
               seat, playing with wheel like child.

               CALO moves to car, and puts lunch basket rear 
               seat.

               Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.

               Over, other side of courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO 
               disappear through gate.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (muttering to himself)
                         Where hell he going?

               MICHAEL goes down hallway, and outside.

               MICHAEL steps out into bright sunlight of outer 
               courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.

               APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay 
               where he is.

                                     APPOLONIA
                              (calling out)
                         I'll drive to you.

               He smiles affectionately.

               CALO stands beside car, smiling, with his lupara dangling 
               by his side. There no sight of FABRIZZIO. Suddenly 
               smile fades from MICHAEL's face. He steps forward and holds 
               out his hand.

                                     MICHAEL
                         No. No!

               His shout drowned roar of tremendous EXPLOSION, 
               as she switched ignition.

               Part of wall caved in, kitchen door blown off; 
               and there nothing left of Alpha, or of Appolonia.

               MICHAEL thrown against wall, and knocked unconscious.

               INT. DAY: VILLA BEDROOM

               MICHAEL unconscious darkened room. We hear whispering 
               around him, but can't make any of it out. A soft cloth 
               applied to his face; gradually his eyes open. DON TOMMASSINO 
               there, close to him. He looks them and from their grave 
               expressions, he knows his wife dead.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Fabrizzio. Let your shepherds know 
                         that one who gives me Fabrizzio 
                         will own finest pastures 
                         Sicily.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)

               Easter.

               A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL springtime. Hordes 
               of little CHILDREN including many of Corleone Children 
               and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets, 
               searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden Easter 
               eggs.

                DON himself, much older, much smaller size, wearing 
               baggy pants and plaid shirt and old hat, moves around 
               his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.

               Suddenly, he stops and looks.

               MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.

               Great emotion comes over DON, who takes few steps 
               MICHAEL's direction.

               MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son 
               and embraces him.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Be my son...

               INT. DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY

               DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through corridors of 
               building.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         This old building has seen its day.
                         No way to do business... too small, 
                         too old.

               They enter DON's glass-panelled office.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Have thought about wife? A 
                         family?

                                     MICHAEL
                              (pained)
                         No.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                          understand, Michael. But must 
                         make family, know.

                                     MICHAEL
                          want children,  want family.
                         But  don't know when.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Accept what's happened, Michael.

                                     MICHAEL
                          could accept everything that's 
                         happened;  could accept it, but 
                         that  never had choice. From 
                         time  was born, had laid this 
                         all out for me.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         No,  wanted other things for you.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You wanted me to be your son.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Yes, but sons who would be professors, 
                         scientists, musicians... and 
                         grandchildren who could be, who knows, 
                         Governor, President even, 
                         nothing's impossible here America.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Then why have  become man like 
                         you?

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         You like me, we refuse to be 
                         fools, to be puppets dancing 
                         string pulled by other men.  hoped 
                         time for guns and killing and 
                         massacres was over. That was my 
                         misfortune. That was your misfortune.  
                          was hunted streets of 
                         Corleone when  was twelve years old 
                         because of who my father was.  had 
                         no choice.

                                     MICHAEL
                         A man has to choose what he will be.
                          believe that.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         What else do believe in?

               MICHAEL doesn't answer.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Believe family. Can believe 
                         your country? Those Pezzonovante 
                         of State who decide what we shall 
                         do with our lives? Who declare wars 
                         they wish us to fight to protect 
                         what they own. Do put your fate 
                         hands of men whose only talent 
                         that they tricked bloc of people 
                         to vote for them? Michael, five 
                         years Corleone family can be 
                         completely legitimate. Very difficult 
                         things have to happen to make that 
                         possible.  can't do them anymore, 
                         but can, if choose to.

               MICHAEL listens.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Believe family; believe

                         believe Roots that go back 
                         thousands of years into your Race.
                         Make family, Michael, and protect 
                         it. These our affairs, sono cosa

                         choice.

                                     FREDO
                         He had business hotel, but 
                         he'll drop for dinner.

               From expression MICHAEL's face we know this 
               discourtesy.

               A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of 
               MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI. Great fuss made. They being 
               shown into hotel's 'special' suite.

                                     FREDO
                         You look wonderful, kid; really 
                         wonderful. That doctor did some job 
                         your face.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You look good, too.

               They enter suite.

                                     FREDO
                         Nice, eh?

               FREDO as excited as kid, snapping orders bellboys, 
               waiters and maids.

                                     FREDO
                              (hurrying into 
                              bedroom)
                         Kid, take look-see.

                                     FREDO
                         Ever seen anything like that before?

                                     MICHAEL
                              (dryly)
                         No.

               MICHAEL alone bedroom. He just finishing 
               dressing; he puts his jacket. From window, with 
               lights blinking, we can tell it's late night. MICHAEL 
               passes into other room.

               He stops, looks. He disturbed.

               INT. NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

               A magnificent, circular table has been set up his suite; 
               lavish table setting for eight. Standing by table

                         Come here minute, Fredo.

               FREDO goes to him, big smile all over his face.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Who those girls?

                                     FREDO
                              (jokingly)
                         That's for to find out.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Give them some money and send them 
                         home.

                                     FREDO
                         Mike!

                                     MICHAEL
                         Get rid of them...

               INT. NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

               They seated around lavish table Michael's suite.

               MICHAEL speaking to JOHNNY.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Johnny, Corleone family

                                     FREDO
                         Mike, sure about Moe selling. He 
                         never mentioned it to me and he loves 
                         business.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'll make him offer he can't 
                         refuse.

               MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Johnny, Don wants to help us

                         Buy me out?...

                                     MICHAEL
                          hotel, casino.  Corleone 
                         family wants to buy out.

               GREENE stops laughing; room becomes tense. NER eyes 
               BODYGUARDS.

                                     MOE
                              (furious)

                         out.  buy out. You don't buy me 
                         out.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Your casino loses money. Maybe we 
                         can do better.

                                     MOE
                         You think  scam?

                                     MICHAEL
                              (the worst insult)
                         You're unlucky.

                                     MOE
                         You goddamn dagos.  do favor 
                         and take Freddie when you're having 
                         bad time, and then try to push 
                         me out.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You took Freddie because 
                         Corleone family bankrolled your 
                         casino. You and Corleone family 
                         evened out. This for business; 
                         name your price.

                                     MOE
                          Corleone family don't have that 
                         kind of muscle anymore.  Godfather 
                         sick. You're getting chased out 
                         of New York by Barzini and other 
                         families, and think can find 
                         easier pickings here. I've talked to 
                         Barzini;  can make deal with him 
                         and keep my hotel!

                                     MICHAEL
                              (quietly, deadly)
                          that why thought could 
                         slap Freddie around public?

                                     FREDO
                              (his face turns red)
                         Ah Mike, that was nothing. Moe didn't 
                         mean anything. He flies off handle 
                         sometimes; but me and him good 
                         friends. Right, Moe?

                                     MOE
                         Yeah sure. Sometimes  gotta kick 
                         asses to make this place run right.
                         Freddie and  had little argument 
                         and  had to straighten him out.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You straightened my brother out?

                                     MOE
                         Hell, he was banging cocktail 
                         waitresses two time. Players 
                         couldn't get drink.

               MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says tone of dismissal:

                                     MICHAEL
                          have to go back to New York 
                         tomorrow. Think of your price.

                                     MOE
                         You son of bitch, think 
                         can brush me off like that?  made 
                         my bones when were going out 
                         with cheerleaders.

                                     FREDO
                              (frightened)
                         Tom, you're Consigliere; can 
                         talk to Don and advise him.

                                     MICHAEL
                          Don has semi-retired. I'm running 
                         Family business now. So anything 
                         have to say, say it to me.

               Nobody answers. MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens door.  
               MOE exits angrily.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Freddie, you're my older brother.  
                         love you. But don't ever take sides 
                         with anybody against Family again.

               KAY sits back of limousine parked by Newark 
               AIRPORT. ROCCO LAMPONE leaning against it.

               She has little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who plays 
               with cardboard bird string.

               Two other cars stationed discreetly, with men we have

               LAMPONE opens car door; KAY steps out with BOY, and 
               MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son. Automatically, 
               luggage put in. NER replaces LAMPONE as driver; and 
               LAMPONE joins other men. HAGEN gets into one of other 
               cars.

               And limo drives off, preceded and followed by other 
               sedans.

                         but never get close to them.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'm busy.

                                     KAY
                         Connie and Carlo want to be 
                         godfather to their little boy.

               NER opens door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.

               He smiles her, tired, and little sad.

                                     KAY
                         Will you?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Let me think about it, O.K.?

               She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NER to Main House; KAY 
               and little BOY move to house that was Sonny's.

               INT. DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)

               VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller size. He 
               wears baggy pants, and warm plaid shirt. He sits chair, 
               gazing out through window, into garden.

                                     TESSIO (O.S.)
                         Barzini's people chisel my territory 
                         and we do nothing about it. Pretty 
                         soon there won't be one place 
                         Brooklyn  can hang my hat.

                                     MICHAEL (O.S.)
                         Just be patient.

                                     TESSIO
                         I'm not asking for help, Mike.
                         Just take off handcuffs.

                                     MICHAEL (O.S.)
                         Be patient.

                                     CLEMENZA (O.S.)
                         We gotta fight sometime. Let us 
                         least recruit our regimes to full 
                         strength.

                                     MICHAEL (O.S.)
                         No,  don't want to give Barzini 
                         excuse to start fighting.

                                     TESSIO (O.S.)
                         Mike, you're wrong.

                                     CLEMENZA (O.S.)
                         Don Corleone... Don Corleone.

                OLD MAN looks up. CLEMENZA stand before him Den.  
               Beside him anxious TESSIO. NER stands by door; 
               HAGEN seated; MICHAEL sits behind big desk.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         You said there would come day when 
                         Tessio and me could form our own 
                         Families. Only with your benediction, 
                         of course.  ask permission...

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         My son head of Family now. If 
                         have his permission, have my 
                         good will.

                                     MICHAEL
                         In six months can break off from 
                         Corleone Family and go your 
                         own. Carlo, I'm counting to 
                         make move to Nevada; you'll be 
                         my right-hand man out there. Tom 
                         Hagen no longer Consigliere.

               Everyone bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.

               He remains inexpressive.

                                     MICHAEL
                         He's going to be our lawyer Vegas. 
                         Nobody goes to him with any other 
                         business as of now, this minute. No 
                         reflection Tom; that's way  
                         want it. Besides, if  ever need any 
                         advice, who's better Consigliere 
                         than my father.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Then six month time we're 
                         our own; that it?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Maybe less...

                                     TESSIO
                         Let us fill up our Regimes.

                                     MICHAEL
                         No.  want things very calm for 
                         another six months.

                                     TESSIO
                         Forgive me, Godfather, let our years 
                         of friendship be my excuse. How can 
                         hope for success there without 
                         your strength here to back up? 
                          two go hand hand. And with 
                         gone from here Barzini and 
                         Tattaglias will be too strong 
                         for us.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         And  don't like Barzini.  say 
                         Corleone Family has to move from 
                         strength, not weakness. We should 
                         build our Regimes and take back our 
                         lost territories Staten Island, 
                         least.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Do have faith my judgement?

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Yes, Godfather...

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Then do what Michael says...

                                     MICHAEL
                         All  can say that things 
                         being resolved that more effective 
                         than thousand buttonmen 
                         streets. Understood?

               There uneasy looks all around.

                                     CARLO
                         Understood.  just wish  was doing 
                         more to help out.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'll come to when  need you.

               He looks CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN. They all nod, 
               reluctantly.

                                     MICHAEL
                         All right, then it's resolved.

               NER knows meeting over, he opens Den's door.

               CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to DON and leave, 
               then CARLO. NER watches CARLO as he walks down corridor, 
               casting nervous look back sinister man.

               Then NER closes door.

               MICHAEL relaxes.

                                     HAGEN
                         Mike, why cutting me out of 
                         action?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Tom, we're going to be legitimate 
                         all way, and you're legal 
                         man. What could be more important 
                         than that.

                                     HAGEN
                         I'm not talking about that. I'm 
                         talking about Rocco Lampone building 
                         secret regime. Why does Neri report 
                         directly to you, rather than through 
                         me or caporegime?

                                     DON CORLEONE
                          told that it wouldn't escape 
                         his eye.

                                     MICHAEL
                         How did find out?

                                     HAGEN
                         Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's 
                         men all little too good for 
                         jobs they're supposed to be doing. 
                         They get little more money than 
                         job's worth.
                              (pause)
                         Lampone's good man; he's operating 
                         perfectly.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Not so perfectly if noticed.

                                     HAGEN
                         Mike, why  out?

                                     MICHAEL
                         You're not wartime Consigliere.
                         Things may get tough with move 
                         we're trying.

                                     HAGEN
                         OK, but then  agree with Tessio. 
                         You're going about it all wrong; 
                         you're making move out of 
                         weakness... Barzini's wolf, and if 
                         he tears apart, other families 
                         won't come running to help 
                         Corleones...

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Tom,  never thought were bad 
                         Consigliere,  thought Santino bad 
                         Don, rest peace. He had good 
                         heart but he wasn't right man to 
                         head family when  had my 
                         misfortune. Michael has all my 
                         confidence, as do. For reasons 
                         which can't know, must have 
                         no part what will happen.

                                     HAGEN
                         Maybe  can help.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (coldly)
                         You're out, Tom.

               TOM pauses, thinks... and then he nods acquiescence. TOM 
               leaves.

               MICHAEL looks NERI.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'm going to talk to my father.

               NER nods, and then leaves.  DON opens doors, breathes 
               air, and steps outside.

               EXT. DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)

                                     DON CORLEONE
                          see have your Luca Brasi.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'll need him.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         There men this world who demand 
                         to be killed. They argue gambling 
                         games; they jump out of their cars 
                         rage if someone so much as 
                         scratches their fender. These people 
                         wander through streets calling 
                         out "Kill me, kill me." Luca Brasi 
                         was like that. And since he wasn't 
                         scared of death, and fact, looked 
                         for it...  made him my weapon. 
                         Because  was only person 
                         world that he truly hoped would not 
                         kill him.  think have done 
                         same with this man.

               They walk through DON's vegetable garden. Tomatoes, 
               peppers, carefully tended, and covered with silky netting.  
               MICHAEL follows; DON turns and looks him. Then stoops 
               over to right tomato plant that had been pushed over.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Barzini will move against first.

                                     MICHAEL
                         How?

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         He will get touch with through 
                         someone absolutely trust. That 
                         person will arrange meeting, 
                         guarantee your safety...

               He rises, and looks Michael...

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         ...and that meeting will be 
                         assassinated.

                DON walks further.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Your wife and children... you're 
                         happy with them?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Yes.

                                     DON CORLEONE
                         Good.

               MICHAEL wants to express something... hesitates, then:

                                     MICHAEL
                         I've always respected you...

               A long silence.  DON smiles MICHAEL.

               EXT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)

               KAY and MAMA walking from black car that has just left 
               them off.

                                     KAY
                         How your husband feeling?

                                     MAMA
                         He's not same since they shot 
                         him. He lets Michael do all work. 
                         He just plays fool with his 
                         garden, his peppers, his tomatoes, 
                         as if he was some peasant still.  
                         But men like that...

               She stops toward Church.

                                     MAMA
                         You come in, too.

               KAY shakes her head.

                                     MAMA
                          Priest ain't gonna bite cause 
                         you're not Catholic.
                              (whispered)
                         He's back drinkin' his wine.

               KAY laughs and follows MAMA up steps of Church.  
               They enter.

               INT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)

               Inside Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from 
               holy water.

                                     MAMA
                         You can.

               Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into water, and blesses 
               herself. Then SHE follows MAMA down aisle, awe 
               high ceiling, art, windows, and finally Altar.

               MAMA stops by impressive tiers of candles. There 
               large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles.  
               MAMA fumbles her purse for change; KAY gives her some.

               MAMA drops coins box, one by one; then takes 
               taper, and pattern known only to her, and with great 
               dignity, she closes her eyes, says prayer, and then lights 
               twenty candles.

               She finishes, and bows her head.

               EXT. DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME

               Very few people streets. TOTAL SILENCE. But black 
               flower cars as far as eye can see, for blocks and blocks.

               An expression of respect, of honor and fear that enormous.

               Certainly no more could be done for President or King.

               Each car carries elaborate floral decoration. We show 
               these detail; and flowered messages: "A Benefactor to 
               Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"... "Our Don Our Leader"... 
               " Sacred Heart"...

               EXT. DAY: MALL (1955)

               HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

               Silence.

                flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill 
               all areas attendant to Corleone residence.

               Hundreds of people fill Mall, reminiscent size of 
               wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now mood somber 
               and respectful.

               MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by flowered platform 
               which holds ornate coffin. We cannot see remains of 
               Don Corleone.

               BONASERA nearby, ready to do service to bereaved 
               family. One by one mourners come by, weeping, or merely 
               with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.

                VIEW ALTERS, and we see that line endless. JOHNNY 
               FONTANE, tears openly falling, takes his turn.

               Children taken by hand, and lifted for their last 
               look great man.

               CLEMENZA whispers into ear of LAMPONE. LAMPONE immediately 
               arranges for members of Five New York Families to 
               pay their respects.

               First CUNEO, then STRACH and then ZALUCHI. Then PHILIP 
               TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by Coffin.

               Then BARZIN black homburg, standing long time.

               MICHAEL watches scene.

               BARZIN crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined 
               by his men.

               As BARZIN leaves, it seems as though everyone fawning 
               him; perhaps asking for favors: But any rate, it clear 
               from doors opened for him, cigars lit for him, that 
               he new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don 
               Corleone.

               MICHAEL watches silently.

               BARZIN searching for somebody with his eyes. First 
               CLEMENZA. Then TESSIO.

               CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears her eyes. He 
               embraces and comforts her.

               Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NER few feet away--watching 
               all who come close to him.

               EXT. DAY: MALL (LATER)

               Later Mall; some people have left, although there 
               still hundreds of mourners.

               A young GIRL approaches TESSIO. She's about 18.

                                     GIRL
                         Do remember me?

                                     TESSIO
                         No...

                                     GIRL
                         We danced together Connie's 
                         wedding.

               TESSIO makes gesture, which to say 'How you've grown', 
               and they move though crowd, looking for Michael. He finds 
               him.

                                     TESSIO
                         Mike, could  have minute?

               MIKE; nods; and they move to private place. NER close 
               by.

                                     TESSIO
                         Barzini wants to arrange meeting.
                         Says we can straighten any of our 
                         problems out.

                                     MICHAEL
                         He talked to you?

                                     TESSIO
                              (nods)
                          can arrange security.

                              (softly)

                                     MICHAEL
                         Not all...  needed another four 
                         months and  would have had them

                         I'll make them call me Don.

                PRIEST pours water over forehead of infant MICHAEL 
               holds.

                                     PRIEST
                         Do wish to be baptized?

                                     MICHAEL
                          do wish to be baptized.

               INT. DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)

               CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs final few steps.

               He walks through some glass doors, and moves to ornate 
               elevator waiting shaft.

                lights indicate elevator has arrived.

                doors open, and we see surprised CUNEO standing with 
               dapper MOE GREENE.

               CLEMENZA fires into small elevator with shotgun.

                PRIEST hands lighted candle to MICHAEL.

                                     PRIEST
                          christen Michael Francis Rizzi.

               Flash bulbs go off. Everyone smiles, and crowds around 
               MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE... and CARLO.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)

                christening party outside Church.

               Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to 
               receive MAMA, CONNIE and baby; and others.

               Everyone very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.

               As fuss going on, car pulls up. LAMPONE gets out 
               and works his way to MICHAEL. He whispers his ear. This 
               news MICHAEL has been waiting for.

               CONNIE holds baby up to MICHAEL.

                                     CONNIE
                         Kiss your Godfather.

                infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as excuse 
               to back away.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Carlo... we've had change 
                         plans. Mama, Connie, Kay and 
                         kids will have to take trip out 
                         to Vegas without us.

                                     CONNIE
                         Oh Mike, it's our first vacation 
                         together.

                                     CARLO
                              (anxious to please)
                         Jesus, Connie... Sure, Mike...

                                     MICHAEL
                         Go back to your house and wait for 
                         me...

               He kisses KAY.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (to KAY)
                         I'll just be couple of days...

               People guided to correct limousines; they start to 
               drive off.

               INT. DAY: DON'S KITCHEN

               TESSIO sits Kitchen of Main House Mall.

               HAGEN enters.

                                     HAGEN
                         You'd better make your call to 
                         Barzini; Michael's ready.

               TESSIO nods; moves to telephone and dials number.

                                     TESSIO
                         We're our way to Brooklyn.

               He hangs up and smiles.

                                     TESSIO
                          hope Mike can get us good deal 
                         tonight.

                                     HAGEN
                              (gravely)
                         I'm sure he will.

               EXT. DAY: MALL (1955)

                TWO MEN walk out onto Mall, toward car. On their 
               way they stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.

                                     BUTTON MAN
                          boss says he'll come separate 
                         car. He says for two to go 
                         ahead.

                                     TESSIO
                              (frowning)
                         Hell, he can't do that. It screws up 
                         all my arrangements.

               THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.

                                     HAGEN
                              (gently)
                          can't go with either, Tessio.

               He flashes men surrounding him; for moment he panics, 
               and then he accepts it.

                                     TESSIO
                              (after pause)
                         Tell Mike it was business...  always 
                         liked him.

                                     HAGEN
                         He understands that.

               TESSIO looks men, and then pauses.

                                     TESSIO
                              (softly)
                         Tom, can get me off hook?
                         For old times' sake?

                                     HAGEN
                          can't.

               HAGEN turns, and walks away from group. Then about twenty 
               paces away, he stops, and looks back.

               TESSIO led into waiting car.

               HAGEN looks away, and walks off.

               INT. DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

               CARLO RIZZ alone his house, smoking, waiting rather 
               nervously. He moves to window and looks out.

               WHAT HE SEES:

               EXT. DAY: MALL (1955)

               MICHAEL, still dressed dark suit; followed by NERI, 
               LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.

               They move toward us.

               Excitedly, CARLO moves to front door; opens it.

               He wears broad smile.

                                     CARLO
                         Godfather!

                                     MICHAEL
                         You have to answer for Santino.

                smile CARLO's face slowly fades, then, foolish 
               attempt for safety, he slams door their faces and 
               backs into living room.

               INT. DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

                door opens, and grim party enters.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You fingered Sonny for Barzini 
                         people. That little farce played 
                         out with my sister. Did Barzini kid 
                         that would fool Corleone?

                                     CARLO
                              (dignity)
                          swear I'm innocent.  swear 
                         head of my children, I'm innocent.  
                         Mike, don't do this to me, please 
                         Mike, don't do this to me!

                                     MICHAEL
                              (quietly)
                         Barzini dead. So Philip 
                         Tattaglia, so Strachi, Cuneo and 
                         Moe Greene...  want to square all 
                         family accounts tonight. So don't 
                         tell me you're innocent; admit what 
                         did.

               CARLO silent; he wants to talk but terrified.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (almost kindly)
                         Don't be frightened. Do think 
                         I'd make my sister widow? Do 
                         think I'd make your children 
                         fatherless? After all, I'm Godfather 
                         to your son. No, your punishment 
                         that you're out of family 
                         business. I'm putting plane 
                         to Vegas--and  want to stay 
                         there. I'll send Connie allowance, 
                         that's all. But don't keep saying 
                         you're innocent; it insults my 
                         intelligence and makes me angry. Who 
                         approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?

                                     CARLO
                              (sees his way out)
                         Barzini.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (softly)
                         Good, good. Leave now; there's car 
                         waiting to take to airport.

               CARLO moves to door; opens it. There car waiting; 
               with group of MEN around it.

               He looks back MICHAEL, who reassures him.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'll call your wife and tell her 
                         what flight you're on.

               EXT. DAY: MALL

               CARLO moves out to Mall; BUTTONMEN putting his 
               things trunk.

               ONE opens front door for him.

               SOMEONE sitting rear seat, though we cannot see 
               who.

               CARLO gets into car; out of nervousness, he looks back 
               to see other man.

               It CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.

                motor starts, and as car pulls away, CLEMENZA suddenly 
               throws garrote around CARLO's neck. He chokes and leaps 
               up like fish line, kicking his feet.

                garrote pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.

               His thrashing feet kick right through front windshield.

               Then body goes slack.

               CLEMENZA makes foul face, and opens window as car 
               drives off.

               EXT. DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)

               MICHAEL and his party. They watch.

               Then he turns and walks off, and they follow.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)

               MICHAEL sits alone back of his car; NER driving.

               They do not speak for long time; it night--car lights 
               flash by.

               NER turns back.

                                     NERI
                         You know  would never question 
                         anything say.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (smiles)
                         Speak your mind.

                                     NERI
                         I'll do this for you; know  
                         should.

                                     MICHAEL
                         No. This  have to do.

               EXT. NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)

               MICHAEL's car pulls up quiet neighborhood, near 
               Italian Pizzeria. NER opens door.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Sit car.

               INT. NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)

               He walks alone into restaurant. A MAN tossing pizza 
               dough air.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Where's boss?

                                     MAN
                         In back. Hey Frank, someone wants 
                         you.

               A MAN comes out of shadows, with strong Italian accent.

                                     MAN
                         What it?

               He stops, frozen fear. It FABRIZZIO.

               VIEW ON MICHAEL. Gunfire from under his coat. FABRIZZIO 
               cut down. MICHAEL throws gun down; turns and exits.

               EXT. DAY: MALL (1955)

               HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

               Several moving vans parked Mall; one feels that 
               these final days; families moving out; signs 
               indicating that property for sale evident.

               A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped, 
               rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out, 
               restrained by MAMA. She manages to break free and runs across 
               Mall into Michael's house.

               INT. DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

               Inside Corleone house. Big boxes have been packed; 
               furniture prepared for shipping.

                                     CONNIE
                         Michael!

               She hurries into living room, where she comes upon MICHAEL 
               and KAY.

                                     KAY
                              (comforting)
                         Connie...

               But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL. NER 
               watchful.

                                     CONNIE
                         You lousy bastard; killed my 
                         husband...

                                     KAY
                         Connie...

                                     CONNIE
                         You waited until our father died and 
                         nobody could stop and killed 
                         him, killed him! You blamed him 
                         about Sonny, always did, everybody 
                         did. But never thought about me, 
                         never gave damn about me.
                              (crying)
                         What  going to do now, what  
                         going to do.

               TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders 
               from him.  But he stands there, waiting for his sister to 
               finish.

                                     KAY
                         Connie, how could say such things?

                                     CONNIE
                         Why do think he kept Carlo 
                         Mall? All time he knew he 
                         was going to kill my husband. But he 
                         didn't dare while my father was alive.  
                         And then he stood Godfather to our 
                         child. That coldhearted bastard.
                              (to KAY)
                         And do know how many men he had 
                         killed with Carlo? Just read 
                         papers. That's your husband.

               She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but her hysteria 
               she has no saliva.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Get her home and get doctor.

                TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her, 
               gently but firmly.

               KAY shocked; never taking her look of amazement from 
               MICHAEL. He feels her look.

                                     MICHAEL
                         She's hysterical.

               But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.

                                     KAY
                         Michael, it's not true. Please tell 
                         me.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Don't ask me.

                                     KAY
                         Tell me!

                                     MICHAEL
                         All right, this one time I'll let 
                         ask about my affairs, one last 
                         time.

                                     KAY
                          it true?

               She looks directly into his eyes, he returns look, so 
               directly that we know he will tell truth.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (after very long 
                              pause)
                         No.

               KAY relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs 
               him. Then she kisses him.

                                     KAY
                              (through her tears)
                         We both need drink.

               INT. DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)

               She moves back into kitchen and begins to prepare 
               drinks. From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes 
               drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NER and ROCCO LAMPONE enter 
               house with their BODYGUARDS.

               She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive 
               them. He stands arrogantly ease, weight resting one 
               foot slightly behind other. One hand his hip, like 
               Roman Emperor.  CAPOREGIMES stand before him.

               CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.

                                     CLEMENZA
                         Don Corleone...

                smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks what her 
               husband has become.

               INT. DAY: CHURCH (1955)

               KAY wears shawl over her hand. She drops many coins 
               coin box, and lifts burning taper, and one by one, 
               pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.

                                         THE END
